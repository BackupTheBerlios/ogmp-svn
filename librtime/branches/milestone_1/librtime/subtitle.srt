1
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,332
(computer beeping)

2
00:04:45,773 --> 00:04:49,402
Bio-readouts are all in the green.
Looks like she's alive.

3
00:04:52,693 --> 00:04:55,730
Well, there goes our salvage, guys.

4
00:05:20,573 --> 00:05:22,564
How are we today?

5
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:24,291
Terrible.

6
00:05:24,373 --> 00:05:26,933
Well, better than yesterday, at least.

7
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,163
- Where am l?
- You're safe.

8
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:32,253
You're at Gateway Station.
Been here a couple of days.

9
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,052
You were pretty groggy at first,
but now you're OK.

10
00:05:35,813 --> 00:05:38,008
Looks like you've got a visitor.

11
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,928
Jonesy! Come here!

12
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,691
Hey, come here!

13
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,044
How are you, you stupid cat?

14
00:05:47,133 --> 00:05:48,452
How are you!

15
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:50,166
Where have you been?

16
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:53,123
Guess you two have met, huh?

17
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:56,331
I'm Burke. Carter Burke.
I work for the company.

18
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:59,446
But... don't let that fool you.
I'm really an OK guy.

19
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:02,523
I'm glad to see you're feeling better.

20
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:06,447
They say that all the weakness
and disorientation should pass soon.

21
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:11,812
That's just natural side effects of such
a long hypersleep. Or something like that.

22
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:14,324
What do you mean?

23
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:16,324
How long was I out there?

24
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:20,607
Has no-one discussed this with you yet?

25
00:06:20,693 --> 00:06:23,082
No. But, I mean, I don't...

26
00:06:24,013 --> 00:06:26,049
..recognise this place.

27
00:06:26,493 --> 00:06:29,087
No, I know. Uh... OK.

28
00:06:29,173 --> 00:06:32,210
It's just that, uh,
this might be a shock to you.

29
00:06:32,293 --> 00:06:34,682
- It's longer...
- How long?

30
00:06:34,773 --> 00:06:35,842
Please.

31
00:06:37,413 --> 00:06:39,131
57 years.

32
00:06:40,613 --> 00:06:41,648
What?

33
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:44,970
That's the thing.
You were out there for 57 years.

34
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:48,770
You had drifted
right through the core systems.

35
00:06:48,853 --> 00:06:51,287
And it's really just blind luck...

36
00:06:51,373 --> 00:06:54,683
..that a deep-salvage team
found you when they did.

37
00:06:54,773 --> 00:06:56,764
It's one in a thousand, really.

38
00:06:56,853 --> 00:06:59,083
You're damn lucky to be alive, kiddo.

39
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:01,767
You could be floating out there forever.

40
00:07:02,653 --> 00:07:04,723
You OK?

41
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:05,723
(hiss)

42
00:07:05,813 --> 00:07:07,212
Uh...

43
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:09,563
(heartbeat)

44
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:11,888
(hiss)

45
00:07:12,373 --> 00:07:13,567
Oh!

46
00:07:13,653 --> 00:07:14,881
You OK?

47
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:21,242
(hiss)

48
00:07:21,853 --> 00:07:22,842
Oh!

49
00:07:23,813 --> 00:07:24,802
God!

50
00:07:26,893 --> 00:07:28,292
Nurse! Please!

51
00:07:29,653 --> 00:07:31,291
Someone get in here now!

52
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:32,806
(Ripley) No!

53
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:34,532
Now!

54
00:07:34,613 --> 00:07:35,762
Hold!

55
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:36,729
Please!

56
00:07:36,813 --> 00:07:38,963
Hold her!

57
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:40,928
Kill me!

58
00:07:48,613 --> 00:07:50,046
No!

59
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:51,691
No!

60
00:07:57,053 --> 00:07:59,044
(Nurse) Bad dreams again?

61
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:02,125
- You want something to help you sleep?
- No.

62
00:08:03,133 --> 00:08:04,885
I've slept enough.

63
00:08:06,613 --> 00:08:09,605
Jonesy... come here.

64
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:10,842
(meows)

65
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:12,731
Shh!

66
00:08:16,853 --> 00:08:18,605
It's all right.

67
00:08:19,853 --> 00:08:21,844
It's all right now.

68
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,325
It's over.

69
00:08:27,333 --> 00:08:29,324
(birds chirping)

70
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:44,765
(chirping stops)

71
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:52,206
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
Been running behind all morning.

72
00:08:52,293 --> 00:08:54,966
Is there any word about my daughter?

73
00:08:55,053 --> 00:08:58,602
Uh... I think we should worry
about the hearing now.

74
00:08:58,693 --> 00:09:00,684
I read your deposition...

75
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,526
..and it's great.
If you stick to that, we'll be fine.

76
00:09:03,613 --> 00:09:06,446
There are gonna be
a lot of heavyweights in there.

77
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:08,603
Feds, lnterstellar Commerce Commission,...

78
00:09:08,693 --> 00:09:11,730
..Colonial Administration,
insurance company guys.

79
00:09:11,813 --> 00:09:14,202
Do you have any news about my daughter?

80
00:09:15,493 --> 00:09:19,691
Well, we did come up with some information.
Why don't we sit down?

81
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:22,492
I was hoping to wait until after the inquest.

82
00:09:22,573 --> 00:09:23,892
Uh...

83
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:30,526
Amanda Ripley McClaren...
Her married name, I guess?

84
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,285
Age 66.

85
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:34,968
And that was at the time of her death,...

86
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:38,842
..which was two years ago.

87
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:41,242
I'm real sorry.

88
00:09:51,973 --> 00:09:52,962
Amy...

89
00:09:55,173 --> 00:09:57,084
She was cremated...

90
00:09:57,173 --> 00:10:00,643
..and interred at Westlake Repository,
in Wisconsin.

91
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:02,724
No children mentioned.

92
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,329
I promised her...

93
00:10:10,093 --> 00:10:13,051
..that I would be home for her birthday.

94
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:17,768
Her eleventh birthday.

95
00:10:21,693 --> 00:10:22,967
Ohh...

96
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:28,372
(investigator) They'd like to go back to this
point about the override destruct order.

97
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,644
I don't understand this.

98
00:10:30,893 --> 00:10:33,612
We have been here for three and a half hours.

99
00:10:33,693 --> 00:10:36,685
How many different ways
do you want the same story?

100
00:10:36,773 --> 00:10:40,163
Look at it from our perspective, please.

101
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:43,005
Please?

102
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:50,806
You admit to detonating the engines of, and
thereby destroying, an M-Class star freighter.

103
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:53,088
An expensive piece of hardware.

104
00:10:53,173 --> 00:10:56,006
(investigator) 42 million in adjusted dollars.

105
00:10:56,093 --> 00:10:58,448
That's minus payload, of course.

106
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:03,607
The lifeboat's flight recorder corroborates
some elements of your account.

107
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:08,528
In that, for reasons unknown,
the Nostromo set down on LV-426,...

108
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:11,252
..an unsurveyed planet at that time.

109
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:16,043
That it resumed its course, and was
subsequently set for self-destruct by you...

110
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,486
..for reasons unknown.

111
00:11:17,573 --> 00:11:19,643
Not for reasons unknown. I told you.

112
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:25,524
We set down there on company orders
to get this thing, which destroyed my crew...

113
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:27,888
..and your expensive ship.

114
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:33,605
The analysis team found no physical
evidence of the creature you describe.

115
00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:35,285
Good!

116
00:11:35,373 --> 00:11:38,763
That's because I blew it out
of the goddamn air lock.

117
00:11:40,093 --> 00:11:41,606
Like I said.

118
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:48,288
Are there any species like
this hostile organism on LV-426?

119
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,682
No. It's a rock. No indigenous life.

120
00:11:52,773 --> 00:11:56,129
Did IQ's just drop sharply while I was away?

121
00:11:56,213 --> 00:12:01,128
Ma'am, I already said it was not indigenous.
It was a derelict spacecraft. An alien ship.

122
00:12:01,213 --> 00:12:02,726
It was not from there.

123
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:05,611
Do you get it? We homed in on its beacon.

124
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:11,165
And found something never recorded once
in over 300 surveyed worlds.

125
00:12:11,973 --> 00:12:13,770
A creature that "gestates...

126
00:12:13,853 --> 00:12:16,492
- ..inside a living human host".
- Yes.

127
00:12:16,573 --> 00:12:17,926
These are your words.

128
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:21,323
- "And has concentrated acid for blood."
- That's right.

129
00:12:22,693 --> 00:12:27,369
Look, I can see where this is going,
but I'm telling you that...

130
00:12:27,453 --> 00:12:30,604
- ..those things exist.
- Thank you, Officer. That will be all.

131
00:12:30,693 --> 00:12:33,491
Please! You're not listening.
Kane - the crew member...

132
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:38,124
Kane, who went into that ship, said
he saw thousands of eggs. Thousands.

133
00:12:38,213 --> 00:12:40,169
Thank you. That will be all.

134
00:12:40,253 --> 00:12:44,883
Goddamn it, that's not all! lf one of those
things gets down here, that will be all!

135
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:50,445
Then all this bullshit that you think is so
important... you can kiss all that goodbye!

136
00:12:56,893 --> 00:12:59,851
It is the finding
of this court of inquiry that...

137
00:12:59,933 --> 00:13:01,924
..Warrant Officer E Ripley,...

138
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:04,891
..NOC 14472,...

139
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:07,646
..has acted with questionable judgment...

140
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:11,965
..and is unfit to hold an ICC licence
as a commercial flight officer.

141
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,924
Said licence is hereby suspended indefinitely.

142
00:13:18,693 --> 00:13:23,813
No criminal charges will be filed against
you at this time, and you are released...

143
00:13:23,893 --> 00:13:27,852
..on your own recognisance for a six-month
period of psychometric probation,...

144
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:32,211
..to include monthly review
by an ICC psychiatric technician.

145
00:13:35,693 --> 00:13:37,684
These proceedings are closed.

146
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:50,044
That could have been... better.

147
00:13:50,133 --> 00:13:52,886
- Look, I think... Ripley?
- Van Leuwen.

148
00:13:53,413 --> 00:13:55,973
Why don't you just check out LV-426?

149
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:58,084
Because I don't have to.

150
00:13:58,173 --> 00:14:02,564
The people there have never complained
about any hostile organism.

151
00:14:02,653 --> 00:14:05,167
What do you mean? What people?

152
00:14:05,253 --> 00:14:06,606
Terraformers.

153
00:14:06,693 --> 00:14:08,445
Planet engineers.

154
00:14:08,533 --> 00:14:13,561
They set up atmosphere processors
to make the air breathable. Takes decades.

155
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,372
It's what we call a Shake 'n' Bake colony.

156
00:14:16,453 --> 00:14:19,968
How many are there? How many colonists?

157
00:14:20,093 --> 00:14:22,891
I don't know. 60, maybe 70, families.

158
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:24,372
Do you mind?

159
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,764
Families.

160
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:32,652
Jesus!

161
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:35,850
(wind howling)

162
00:15:44,093 --> 00:15:46,607
I'll be down in maintenance, OK?

163
00:15:46,693 --> 00:15:48,809
- Al?
- What?

164
00:15:48,893 --> 00:15:50,292
- Hey, Al.
- What?

165
00:15:50,373 --> 00:15:54,207
Remember you sent some wildcatters
out past the alien range last week?

166
00:15:54,293 --> 00:15:55,282
Yeah.

167
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:57,364
One of them's on the horn.

168
00:15:57,453 --> 00:16:00,968
Says he's on to something.
Wants to know if his claim will be honoured.

169
00:16:01,053 --> 00:16:03,328
Why wouldn't his claim be honoured?

170
00:16:03,413 --> 00:16:06,803
Because you sent them
on company orders, maybe?

171
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:11,364
Christ! Some honch in a cushy office on
Earth says "Go look at a grid reference".

172
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:14,445
We look. They don't say why and I don't ask.

173
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:17,809
I don't ask because it takes two weeks
to get an answer out here.

174
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,963
And the answer is always "Don't ask".

175
00:16:20,053 --> 00:16:22,044
So what do I tell this guy?

176
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:25,842
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned,
if he finds something, it is his.

177
00:16:25,933 --> 00:16:27,924
- Lydecker?
- What?

178
00:16:28,013 --> 00:16:31,528
You kids are not supposed
to be on this level! Get out of here!

179
00:16:39,853 --> 00:16:41,844
(wind howling)

180
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:05,208
You go in places we can't fit!

181
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:08,046
So? That's why I'm the best!

182
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:12,809
Knock it off! lf I catch you playing
in the air ducts again, I'll tan your hides.

183
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:14,849
Mom, all the kids play...

184
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,401
Annie, come and have
a look at this, will ya?

185
00:17:27,853 --> 00:17:30,526
Folks, we have scored big this time.

186
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:38,125
What is it, Dad?

187
00:17:42,573 --> 00:17:44,086
I'm not sure.

188
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:48,684
Let's see if we can't get
a closer look at this thing.

189
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:53,210
- Shouldn't we call in?
- Let's wait till we know what to call it in as.

190
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:59,088
That's about as close as we can get.

191
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,324
Should we take a look inside?

192
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:20,369
You kids stay inside. I mean it.
We'll be right back.

193
00:18:20,453 --> 00:18:22,205
- OK.
- Bye.

194
00:19:36,893 --> 00:19:39,612
Timmy, they've been gone a long time.

195
00:19:39,693 --> 00:19:42,526
It'll be OK. Dad knows what he's doing.

196
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:47,888
Mayday! Mayday! This is Alpha Kilo
Two Four Niner calling Alpha Control!

197
00:19:47,973 --> 00:19:50,851
This is Alpha Kilo Two Four Niner!

198
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:53,163
(girl screams)

199
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,847
(cat meows)

200
00:20:28,893 --> 00:20:30,212
(doorbell)

201
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:38,772
Hi, Ripley. This is Lieutenant Gorman
of the Colonial Marine Corps...

202
00:20:40,213 --> 00:20:42,204
Ripley, we have to talk.

203
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:46,049
We've lost contact with the colony on LV-426.

204
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,284
I don't believe this.

205
00:20:54,373 --> 00:20:56,443
You guys throw me to the wolves...

206
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:59,001
..and now you want me to go back out there?

207
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:01,482
Forget it. It's not my problem.

208
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:02,926
- Can I finish?
- No.

209
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,004
There's no way.

210
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:10,410
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.
I can guarantee your safety.

211
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:16,045
These Colonial Marines are tough hombres.
They're packing state-of-the-art firepower.

212
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,363
There's nothing they can't handle.

213
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:19,568
Am I right?

214
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,123
We've been trained to deal
with situations like this.

215
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:25,773
Then you don't need me. I'm not a soldier.

216
00:21:26,453 --> 00:21:30,731
We don't know what's going on out there.
It may just be a downed transmitter.

217
00:21:30,813 --> 00:21:32,804
But if it's not...

218
00:21:33,253 --> 00:21:36,962
..l would like you there as an advisor,
and that's all.

219
00:21:39,493 --> 00:21:42,769
What's your interest in all this?
Why are you going?

220
00:21:42,853 --> 00:21:47,768
The corporation co-financed that colony
along with Colonial Administration.

221
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:51,004
We're doing a lot of terraforming,
building better worlds...

222
00:21:51,093 --> 00:21:53,243
Yeah. I saw the commercial.

223
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,370
Look, I don't have time for this.
I've got to get to work.

224
00:21:56,453 --> 00:21:59,490
Oh, right.
I heard you're working the cargo docks.

225
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:01,211
That's right.

226
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:04,012
- Running loaders and forklifts.
- Yeah. So?

227
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:07,324
Nothing. I think it's great
that you're keeping busy.

228
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:12,771
And I know it's the only thing that you
could get. There's nothing wrong with it.

229
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:18,483
What would you say if I told you
I could get you reinstated as a flight officer?

230
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:21,929
The company's already agreed
to pick up your contract.

231
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:23,446
If I go.

232
00:22:25,173 --> 00:22:26,606
If you go.

233
00:22:26,693 --> 00:22:29,924
Come on, that's a second chance, kiddo.

234
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:33,926
Get out there and face this thing.
Get back on the horse.

235
00:22:34,013 --> 00:22:36,971
Spare me, Burke.
I've had my psych evaluation this month.

236
00:22:37,053 --> 00:22:39,851
Yeah, I know. I've read it.
You wake up every night,...

237
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:43,243
- ..soaked in sweat...
- I said no! And I mean it!

238
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:47,444
Now please leave.

239
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:51,924
I am not going back! And I am...
I would not be any good to you if I did.

240
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:53,048
OK.

241
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:54,168
Shh.

242
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:59,729
Would you do me a favour?
Just think about it.

243
00:23:02,293 --> 00:23:04,284
Thanks for the coffee.

244
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:14,645
(cat meows)

245
00:23:16,213 --> 00:23:17,612
Aagh!

246
00:23:23,453 --> 00:23:24,852
Ohh!

247
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:01,807
(beeping)

248
00:24:10,053 --> 00:24:11,850
Hello.

249
00:24:12,053 --> 00:24:15,204
Ripley? You OK?

250
00:24:15,293 --> 00:24:17,932
Just tell me one thing, Burke.

251
00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:20,971
You're going out there to destroy them, right?

252
00:24:21,053 --> 00:24:22,532
Not to study.

253
00:24:22,613 --> 00:24:24,251
Not to bring back.

254
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:26,005
But to wipe them out.

255
00:24:27,093 --> 00:24:29,971
That's the plan. You have my word on it.

256
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:34,250
All right, I'm in.

257
00:24:43,853 --> 00:24:46,287
And you, you little shithead,...

258
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:48,364
..you're staying here.

259
00:25:13,413 --> 00:25:15,404
(door creaks)

260
00:25:37,813 --> 00:25:39,804
(chain jangling)

261
00:26:30,693 --> 00:26:33,002
(beeping)

262
00:27:14,213 --> 00:27:17,364
They ain't payin' us enough for this, man.

263
00:27:17,773 --> 00:27:20,970
Not enough to have to
wake up to your face, Drake.

264
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:22,042
What?

265
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:25,489
- Is that a joke?
- Oh, I wish it were!

266
00:27:25,573 --> 00:27:30,328
Hey, Hicks. Man, you look just like I feel.

267
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:35,808
All right, sweethearts,
what are you waiting for? Breakfast in bed?

268
00:27:35,893 --> 00:27:38,168
Another glorious day in the Corps!

269
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:40,767
A day in the Marine Corps
is like a day on the farm.

270
00:27:40,853 --> 00:27:44,163
Every meal's a banquet,
every paycheck a fortune.

271
00:27:44,253 --> 00:27:45,811
Every formation a parade.

272
00:27:45,893 --> 00:27:47,212
I love the Corps!

273
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:50,052
Man, this floor is freezing!

274
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:53,170
- You want me to fetch your slippers?
- Gee, would you, sir?

275
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:55,130
Look into my eye.

276
00:27:55,213 --> 00:27:56,328
Fall in, people!

277
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:58,722
Come on, let's go.

278
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:00,565
I hate this job.

279
00:28:00,653 --> 00:28:03,531
(Apone) Crowe! Wierzbowski! On your feet!

280
00:28:05,053 --> 00:28:08,489
(Frost) I'm talking about breathing,
not this frozen shit.

281
00:28:08,573 --> 00:28:11,007
(Dietrich) Yeah, Top, how about it?

282
00:28:13,653 --> 00:28:17,726
(Apone) All right, first assembly's
in 15, people. Shag it!

283
00:28:18,853 --> 00:28:21,413
(Vasquez) Hey, mira. Who's Snow White?

284
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:24,883
She's supposed to be
some kind of consultant.

285
00:28:24,973 --> 00:28:27,248
Apparently, she saw an alien once.

286
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:30,052
Whoopee-fucking-doo!
Hey, I'm impressed.

287
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:31,612
Qué bonita!

288
00:28:33,453 --> 00:28:35,284
Hey, Vasquez.

289
00:28:35,373 --> 00:28:38,490
Have you ever been mistaken for a man?

290
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:40,325
No. Have you?

291
00:28:40,413 --> 00:28:42,210
Oh, Vasquez!

292
00:28:43,093 --> 00:28:45,084
You're just too bad.

293
00:28:55,453 --> 00:28:57,444
Hey, Top, what's the op?

294
00:28:57,533 --> 00:29:00,001
It's a rescue mission. You'll love it.

295
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:04,644
There's some juicy colonists' daughters
we have to rescue from their virginity.

296
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:08,206
(Spunkmeyer) Dumb-ass colonists!

297
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:12,688
What's this crap supposed to be?

298
00:29:12,773 --> 00:29:15,685
- Cornbread, I think.
- It's good for you, boy. Eat it.

299
00:29:15,773 --> 00:29:20,972
I sure wouldn't mind getting more of that
Arcturian poontang. Remember that time?

300
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:26,411
- But the one that you had was male!
- Doesn't matter when it's Arcturian, baby!

301
00:29:26,493 --> 00:29:29,451
- Hey, Bishop. Do the thing with the knife.
- Oh, please...

302
00:29:29,533 --> 00:29:31,125
(shouts of encouragement)

303
00:29:31,213 --> 00:29:32,168
All right!

304
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:34,847
(Apone) I don't wanna see that, man.

305
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:36,730
(Hudson) Come on, man. All right!

306
00:29:36,813 --> 00:29:39,646
Hey, what are you doing, man?
What are you doing?

307
00:29:39,733 --> 00:29:41,769
- Don't move.
- Quit messing, Drake!

308
00:29:41,853 --> 00:29:43,332
Bishop! Hey, man!

309
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:45,643
- Do it, Bishop.
- Hey, not me, man!

310
00:29:45,733 --> 00:29:47,849
Yeah, you. Don't move.

311
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:49,161
Trust me.

312
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:57,369
Aaaaggghhhhhh!

313
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,208
(Apone) All right, knock it off.

314
00:30:04,293 --> 00:30:05,203
Thank you.

315
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,652
(laughter)

316
00:30:08,893 --> 00:30:10,485
Enjoy your meal.

317
00:30:10,573 --> 00:30:13,212
That wasn't funny, man.

318
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:17,645
- Lieutenant Gorman?
- No.

319
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,610
- Mr Burke?
- Yeah, thanks.

320
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:24,562
Looks like the new lieutenant's too good
to eat with the rest of us grunts.

321
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:29,091
The boy's definitely
got a corncob up his ass.

322
00:30:30,053 --> 00:30:32,806
I thought you never missed, Bishop.

323
00:30:35,653 --> 00:30:38,565
You never said an android
was on board. Why not?

324
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:42,447
It never occurred to me.

325
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:45,411
It's common practice
to have a synthetic on board.

326
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:48,007
I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.

327
00:30:48,853 --> 00:30:49,842
Right.

328
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,493
- Is there a problem?
- I'm sorry.

329
00:30:52,573 --> 00:30:56,771
I didn't even... Ripley's last trip, the syn...
The artificial person...

330
00:30:56,853 --> 00:30:59,003
- ..malfunctioned.
- Malfunctioned?

331
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:02,529
There were problems and...
a few deaths were involved.

332
00:31:02,613 --> 00:31:05,685
I'm shocked.
Was it an older model?

333
00:31:05,773 --> 00:31:08,333
Yeah. The Hyperdyne Systems 120-A-2.

334
00:31:08,413 --> 00:31:10,643
The A-2s always were a bit twitchy.

335
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:13,930
That could never happen now
with our behavioural inhibitors.

336
00:31:14,013 --> 00:31:18,052
It is impossible for me to harm,
or allow to be harmed, a human being.

337
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:20,124
You sure you don't want some?

338
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:22,169
(tray clatters)

339
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:24,767
Just stay away from me, Bishop.

340
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:30,610
Guess she don't like the cornbread, either.

341
00:31:42,573 --> 00:31:45,531
(Apone) Squad! Atten-hut! Officer on deck!

342
00:31:45,613 --> 00:31:47,365
(Gorman) As you were.

343
00:31:47,453 --> 00:31:49,921
Quickly, quickly. Settle down.

344
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:51,731
All right, listen up!

345
00:31:53,253 --> 00:31:58,088
Morning, Marines. I'm sorry we didn't have
time to brief you before we left Gateway...

346
00:31:58,173 --> 00:32:00,528
- Sir?
- What is it, Hicks?

347
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:03,605
Hudson, sir. He's Hicks.

348
00:32:04,853 --> 00:32:06,445
What's the question?

349
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:10,162
Is this gonna be a stand-up fight, sir,
or another bug hunt?

350
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:14,166
All we know is there's still
no contact with the colony,...

351
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:17,006
..and a xenomorph may be involved.

352
00:32:17,093 --> 00:32:19,891
- Excuse me, sir. A what?
- A xenomorph.

353
00:32:19,973 --> 00:32:23,648
It's a bug hunt.
What exactly are we dealing with here?

354
00:32:24,373 --> 00:32:25,965
Ripley?

355
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:28,524
I'll tell you what I know.

356
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:31,328
We set down on LV-426.

357
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:35,247
A crew member was brought back
with something attached to his face,...

358
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,324
..some kind of parasite.

359
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,052
We tried to get it off. It wouldn't come off.

360
00:32:40,133 --> 00:32:42,931
Later, it seemed to come off by itself and die.

361
00:32:43,013 --> 00:32:45,129
Kane seemed fine.

362
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,329
We were all having dinner.

363
00:32:47,413 --> 00:32:51,645
It must have laid something inside
his throat, some sort of embryo.

364
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:53,451
He started...

365
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:55,524
Um, he...

366
00:32:55,613 --> 00:32:58,605
Look, man,
I only need to know one thing :

367
00:32:58,693 --> 00:33:00,684
Where they are.

368
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:03,333
- Go, Vasquez, kick ass!
- Anytime, anywhere.

369
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:07,850
Somebody said "alien". She thought
they said "illegal alien" and signed up!

370
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:09,969
- Fuck you, man.
- Anytime, anywhere.

371
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:11,566
Are you finished?

372
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:20,121
I hope you're right. I really do.

373
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:24,972
Yeah, OK, right. Thank you, Ripley.

374
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:28,443
We also have Ripley's report on disk.
I suggest you study it.

375
00:33:28,533 --> 00:33:32,845
One of those things managed to wipe out
my entire crew in less than 24 hours.

376
00:33:32,933 --> 00:33:38,246
If the colonists have found that ship, there's
no telling how many have been exposed.

377
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,686
Do you understand?

378
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,450
Anyway, we have it on disk, so look at it.

379
00:33:44,533 --> 00:33:47,093
Any questions?

380
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:49,448
What is it, Private?

381
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:52,411
How do I get out of this chickenshit outfit?

382
00:33:52,493 --> 00:33:54,165
You secure that shit, Hudson.

383
00:33:56,853 --> 00:33:58,445
All right.

384
00:33:59,013 --> 00:34:00,810
Now listen up.

385
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:06,243
I want this thing to go smooth
and by the numbers.

386
00:34:07,133 --> 00:34:11,763
I want DCS and tactical
database assimilation by 0830.

387
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:16,881
Ordnance loading, weapons strip and
drop-ship prep details. We have seven hours.

388
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:19,244
Now move it, people!

389
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:23,611
You heard the man, and you know the drill!
Assholes and elbows!

390
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:26,082
Hudson, come here. Come here!

391
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:43,531
I don't care if you are short, Hudson.
Get it done!

392
00:34:43,613 --> 00:34:48,403
- Sarge, you'll get lip cancer smoking those!
- Corporal, I want this loading lock sealed!

393
00:34:48,613 --> 00:34:51,173
- How many more, Spunkmeyer?
- Last one.

394
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:53,050
Good. Take it away.

395
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:11,524
Clear behind.

396
00:35:17,333 --> 00:35:20,131
Did you check number three?
ls this the non-op?

397
00:35:20,213 --> 00:35:23,683
I feel like kind of a fifth wheel.
Is there anything I can do?

398
00:35:23,773 --> 00:35:26,082
I don't know. Is there anything you can do?

399
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:30,643
Well, I can drive that loader.

400
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:33,964
I have a Class Two rating.

401
00:35:35,053 --> 00:35:36,725
Be my guest.

402
00:36:20,413 --> 00:36:22,051
Where you want it?

403
00:36:25,773 --> 00:36:27,570
Bay twelve, please.

404
00:37:21,613 --> 00:37:24,889
(Apone) We're a team and
there's nothing to worry about.

405
00:37:24,973 --> 00:37:30,206
We come here, and we gonna conquer, and
we gonna take some. Is that understood?

406
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:33,683
That's what we gonna do, sweethearts.
Gonna go and get some.

407
00:37:33,773 --> 00:37:36,367
All right, people, on the ready-line!

408
00:37:36,453 --> 00:37:38,091
- Are you lean?
- (all) Yeah!

409
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:39,606
- Are you mean?
- Yeah!

410
00:37:39,693 --> 00:37:41,729
- What are you?
- Lean, mean Marines!

411
00:37:43,093 --> 00:37:45,812
Get on the ready-line! Get some today!

412
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,924
Get on the ready-line!

413
00:37:48,173 --> 00:37:50,209
Move it out!
Move it out, goddamn it!

414
00:37:50,293 --> 00:37:53,922
Get hot! One, two, three!
Get out! Get out! Get out!

415
00:37:54,013 --> 00:37:57,210
Move it out! Move it out! Move it out!

416
00:37:57,293 --> 00:37:59,887
One, two, three, four! One, two, three!

417
00:37:59,973 --> 00:38:01,486
(growls)

418
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,569
Absolutely badasses!

419
00:38:03,653 --> 00:38:05,803
Let's pack 'em in! Get in there!

420
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:07,885
Move it!

421
00:38:07,973 --> 00:38:11,966
- Let's go, let's go!
- One, two, three, four, five, six!

422
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:16,851
I want combat seating. You know your places.

423
00:38:18,133 --> 00:38:20,363
Get those weapons stowed. Let's go!

424
00:38:20,453 --> 00:38:22,444
Come on, settle down, people.

425
00:38:23,693 --> 00:38:25,809
Lock 'em in, Hudson.

426
00:38:25,893 --> 00:38:29,044
Ready to get it on? You know it!

427
00:38:29,133 --> 00:38:31,727
OK, Bishop, let's go.

428
00:38:31,813 --> 00:38:33,849
Roger.

429
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:37,604
I'm ready, man.

430
00:38:38,333 --> 00:38:41,643
Ready to get it on! Go!

431
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,452
Stand by. Cross-locking now.
Pre-launch auto-cycle engaged.

432
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:55,923
Primary couplers released.
Hit the internals.

433
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:11,288
Confiirm cross-lock
and drop stations secured.

434
00:39:11,373 --> 00:39:14,171
(Gorman) Affirmative.
All drop stations secured.

435
00:39:17,693 --> 00:39:19,172
Stand by. Ten seconds.

436
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:25,087
Stand by to initiate release sequencer.

437
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:26,572
On my mark.

438
00:39:27,693 --> 00:39:29,888
We're on an express elevator to hell!

439
00:39:29,973 --> 00:39:31,088
Going down!

440
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:34,051
Two, one, mark.

441
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:38,523
Whoo-hoo!

442
00:39:49,173 --> 00:39:51,641
Switch to DCS ranging.

443
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:56,045
- 2-4-0. Nominal to profile.
- We're in the pipe. Five by five.

444
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:10,849
- We're picking up some hull ionisation.
- Got it. Rough air ahead.

445
00:40:10,933 --> 00:40:13,128
We're in for some chop.

446
00:40:25,493 --> 00:40:28,451
How many drops is this for you, Lieutenant?

447
00:40:30,693 --> 00:40:31,967
38.

448
00:40:33,693 --> 00:40:34,921
Simulated.

449
00:40:35,013 --> 00:40:37,049
How many combat drops?

450
00:40:37,133 --> 00:40:38,691
Uh, two...

451
00:40:39,413 --> 00:40:41,051
..including this one.

452
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:44,330
- (Drake) Shit!
- Oh, man!

453
00:40:56,453 --> 00:41:00,287
Range 0-1-4. Turning on final.

454
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:07,926
(Frost) I got a bad feeling about this drop.

455
00:41:08,013 --> 00:41:11,562
(Crowe) You always say
"l got a bad feeling about this drop".

456
00:41:11,653 --> 00:41:12,802
OK, OK.

457
00:41:12,893 --> 00:41:16,203
When we get back without you,
I'll call your folks.

458
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:22,642
All right. Let's see what we can see.

459
00:41:22,933 --> 00:41:26,209
Everybody on-line. Looking good.

460
00:41:28,053 --> 00:41:31,329
Drake, check your camera.
There seems to be a malfunction.

461
00:41:31,413 --> 00:41:32,607
That's better.

462
00:41:33,533 --> 00:41:35,967
Pan it around a bit. Good.

463
00:41:36,053 --> 00:41:40,683
I'm ready, man. Check it out.
I am the ultimate badass!

464
00:41:40,773 --> 00:41:43,162
State-of-the-badass-art!

465
00:41:43,573 --> 00:41:46,041
You do not wanna fuck with me.

466
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:47,930
Check it out.

467
00:41:50,093 --> 00:41:52,323
Hey, Ripley, don't worry.

468
00:41:52,413 --> 00:41:56,691
Me and my squad of ultimate
badasses will protect you.

469
00:41:57,813 --> 00:41:59,371
Check it out.

470
00:42:00,053 --> 00:42:03,329
Independently targeting
particle-beam phalanx.

471
00:42:03,413 --> 00:42:04,971
Whap!

472
00:42:05,213 --> 00:42:09,252
Fry half a city with this puppy!
We got tactical smart missiles,...

473
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:15,044
..phase plasma pulse rifles, RPGs...
We got sonic electronic ballbreakers!

474
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:18,330
We got nukes.
We got knives, sharp sticks...

475
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:19,971
(Apone) Knock it off, Hudson!

476
00:42:20,053 --> 00:42:21,202
All right, gear up.

477
00:42:21,293 --> 00:42:24,922
Two minutes, people. Get hot.

478
00:42:25,013 --> 00:42:26,685
Somebody wake up Hicks.

479
00:42:38,293 --> 00:42:42,969
- Coming around for a seven-zero-niner.
- Terminal guidance locked in.

480
00:42:43,053 --> 00:42:44,850
Where's the damn beacon?

481
00:42:45,853 --> 00:42:47,445
Oh, I see it.

482
00:42:53,213 --> 00:42:56,364
- That's the atmosphere processor?
- Yep, that's it.

483
00:42:56,453 --> 00:42:59,604
Remarkable piece of machinery.
Completely automated.

484
00:42:59,693 --> 00:43:02,082
We manufacture those, by the way.

485
00:43:11,893 --> 00:43:14,009
(Gorman) OK, Ferro.

486
00:43:14,093 --> 00:43:16,323
Take us in low over the main colony complex.

487
00:43:16,413 --> 00:43:19,928
Storm shutters are sealed.

488
00:43:20,013 --> 00:43:23,722
There's no visible activity.
All right. Hold at forty.

489
00:43:23,813 --> 00:43:26,646
- Roger.
- Give me a slow circle of the complex.

490
00:43:34,213 --> 00:43:35,771
Structure seems intact.

491
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,364
They still have power.

492
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:42,286
(Gorman) OK, Ferro.
Set down on the landing grid.

493
00:43:42,373 --> 00:43:45,410
Immediate dust-off on my clear,
then stay on station.

494
00:43:58,813 --> 00:44:01,088
(Ferro) Down and clear.

495
00:44:02,173 --> 00:44:04,243
Ten seconds, people. Look sharp!

496
00:44:07,173 --> 00:44:10,404
I want a nice, clean dispersal this time.

497
00:44:11,973 --> 00:44:13,964
Let's go! Move it out!

498
00:44:14,053 --> 00:44:15,884
Head 'em out!

499
00:44:36,013 --> 00:44:40,052
First squad up, on-line.
Hicks, get yours in a cordon. Watch the rear.

500
00:44:40,133 --> 00:44:41,885
(Apone) Vasquez, take point.

501
00:44:41,973 --> 00:44:43,531
Let's move!

502
00:44:50,693 --> 00:44:52,092
Move up.

503
00:44:56,413 --> 00:44:58,404
Hudson, run a bypass.

504
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,331
Second squad, move up.
Flanking positions.

505
00:45:05,413 --> 00:45:07,051
Second squad, on-line.

506
00:45:34,973 --> 00:45:36,964
(Apone) You set?

507
00:45:39,453 --> 00:45:41,045
Go on.

508
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:07,612
Second team, move inside.

509
00:46:07,693 --> 00:46:09,684
Hicks, take the upper level.

510
00:46:35,813 --> 00:46:38,008
(Apone) Sir, you copying this?

511
00:46:38,093 --> 00:46:40,607
Looks like hits from small-arms fiire.

512
00:46:40,693 --> 00:46:45,721
We got some explosive damages,
probably seismic survey charges.

513
00:46:45,813 --> 00:46:47,246
Are you reading this?

514
00:46:47,333 --> 00:46:48,891
Keep it tight, people.

515
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:05,843
(Gorman) Hicks, Hudson,
use your motion trackers.

516
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:24,125
(Hicks) Nothing.

517
00:47:24,213 --> 00:47:26,408
Not a goddamn thing.

518
00:47:31,893 --> 00:47:33,884
Quarter and search by twos.

519
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:48,127
(Hicks) OK, Dietrich, Frost, you're up.

520
00:47:54,053 --> 00:47:55,645
(Drake sniffss)

521
00:48:15,453 --> 00:48:16,727
(beeping)

522
00:48:21,173 --> 00:48:23,448
(motion sensor beeping)

523
00:48:28,093 --> 00:48:30,084
(beeping louder)

524
00:48:32,893 --> 00:48:34,690
It's right in there.

525
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:47,327
- Now!
- Now!

526
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:52,007
Good one, Hudson!

527
00:48:52,093 --> 00:48:57,042
Uh, sir, we have a negative situation here.
Uh, moving on, sir.

528
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,684
Wait, tell him to...

529
00:49:09,413 --> 00:49:11,085
Hicks, back up.

530
00:49:11,173 --> 00:49:12,925
Pan right.

531
00:49:14,173 --> 00:49:15,925
There.

532
00:49:16,013 --> 00:49:17,844
(Hicks) You seeing this?

533
00:49:19,813 --> 00:49:24,091
Looks melted. Somebody must have
bagged one ofRipley's bad guys here.

534
00:49:25,173 --> 00:49:26,891
Acid for blood.

535
00:49:26,973 --> 00:49:30,090
If you liked that, you're gonna love this.

536
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:44,684
Quit screwing around.

537
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,923
Second squad, what's your status?

538
00:49:47,013 --> 00:49:50,050
(Hicks) Wejust fiinished our sweep.
Nobody's home.

539
00:49:50,133 --> 00:49:52,089
Roger. Sir, this place is dead.

540
00:49:52,173 --> 00:49:54,733
Whatever happened here, we missed it.

541
00:49:55,173 --> 00:49:57,164
The area's secured.

542
00:49:57,253 --> 00:49:59,005
Let's go check their computer.

543
00:49:59,093 --> 00:50:01,402
- It's not secure.
- The area's secured.

544
00:50:01,493 --> 00:50:04,371
First team, head for Operations.

545
00:50:04,453 --> 00:50:07,411
- Hudson, get their CPU on-line.
- Affirmative.

546
00:50:07,493 --> 00:50:10,803
Hicks, meet me at the south lock.
We're coming in.

547
00:50:10,893 --> 00:50:14,283
He's coming in. I feel safer already.

548
00:50:14,373 --> 00:50:16,364
Pendejo jerkoff!

549
00:50:35,253 --> 00:50:37,972
Sir, we got the CPU on-line.

550
00:50:38,053 --> 00:50:39,532
No problem.

551
00:50:39,613 --> 00:50:42,081
Good. Stand by in Operations.

552
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:44,691
OK, let's go.

553
00:50:49,333 --> 00:50:51,324
(wind howling)

554
00:51:04,053 --> 00:51:05,805
Are you all right?

555
00:51:07,093 --> 00:51:08,572
Yes.

556
00:51:24,493 --> 00:51:27,405
Sir... They sealed off this wing at both ends.

557
00:51:27,493 --> 00:51:32,203
Welded the doors, and blocked off
the stairs with heavy equipment.

558
00:51:32,293 --> 00:51:35,205
But it looks like the barricade didn't hold.

559
00:51:35,813 --> 00:51:37,565
- Any bodies?
- No, sir.

560
00:51:37,653 --> 00:51:39,325
Last stand.

561
00:51:39,413 --> 00:51:41,881
(Drake) Must have been a hell of a fight.

562
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,964
Yeah, looks that way.

563
00:51:46,493 --> 00:51:51,362
All right, Drake, this way. You should be able
to cut through the med lab to Operations.

564
00:52:40,053 --> 00:52:41,964
(Hicks) Lieutenant.

565
00:52:44,853 --> 00:52:46,571
Gorman.

566
00:53:02,373 --> 00:53:04,409
Are those the same ones?

567
00:53:17,093 --> 00:53:18,082
Careful, Burke.

568
00:53:28,493 --> 00:53:32,008
Looks like love at first sight to me.

569
00:53:32,093 --> 00:53:34,163
Oh, he likes you, Burke.

570
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:36,926
Two are alive. The rest are dead.

571
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:41,564
Surgically removed
before embryo implantation.

572
00:53:41,653 --> 00:53:45,532
Subject: Marachuk, John J,
died during the procedure.

573
00:53:46,253 --> 00:53:48,562
They killed him taking it off.

574
00:53:48,773 --> 00:53:49,967
(beeping)

575
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:52,171
Yo, Hicks.

576
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,804
I think we got something here.

577
00:53:59,693 --> 00:54:01,604
- Behind us.
- One of us?

578
00:54:01,693 --> 00:54:04,571
(Gorman) Apone, where are your people?

579
00:54:04,653 --> 00:54:08,328
- Anybody in D-Block?
- Negative. We're all in Operations.

580
00:54:10,053 --> 00:54:12,044
(beeping continues)

581
00:54:12,173 --> 00:54:15,722
- Talk to me, Frosty.
- Let's keep moving, baby.

582
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:27,968
(crash)

583
00:54:33,413 --> 00:54:35,643
- It's moving.
- Which way?

584
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:37,689
It's coming straight for us.

585
00:54:37,773 --> 00:54:39,365
Straight up.

586
00:54:54,733 --> 00:54:56,769
(beeping louder)

587
00:55:15,213 --> 00:55:17,204
- Fuck!
- Hold up!

588
00:55:18,253 --> 00:55:19,732
Ripley.

589
00:55:38,533 --> 00:55:41,127
Hey... shh, it's all right.

590
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:43,647
- It's all right.
- Grab her, Corporal.

591
00:55:43,733 --> 00:55:46,691
Don't be afraid.
Come on. We won't hurt you.

592
00:55:46,773 --> 00:55:49,128
Shh... it's all right. It's OK.

593
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:52,285
Come on out. Come on. Easy, easy.

594
00:55:52,373 --> 00:55:53,203
I got her!

595
00:55:53,293 --> 00:55:55,170
Ow! Damn!

596
00:55:55,253 --> 00:55:57,892
- Don't let her go!
- She's under the grill!

597
00:55:57,973 --> 00:56:01,283
- Frost, get your light up here.
- Where'd she go?

598
00:56:03,973 --> 00:56:05,964
Shine the light!

599
00:56:06,053 --> 00:56:07,611
Down here.

600
00:56:07,693 --> 00:56:09,331
Here. Here.

601
00:56:09,413 --> 00:56:11,927
(Ripley) Keep back. Don't scare her.

602
00:56:12,013 --> 00:56:14,607
- Grab her, man! We're gonna lose her!
- Damn it!

603
00:56:21,053 --> 00:56:22,850
(Ripley) Wait!

604
00:56:47,253 --> 00:56:50,131
It's OK. It's all right.

605
00:56:51,133 --> 00:56:52,851
Don't be afraid.

606
00:56:54,773 --> 00:56:56,365
See?

607
00:56:56,853 --> 00:56:58,684
Wait! No, you don't!

608
00:56:58,773 --> 00:57:02,083
It's OK! You're gonna be all right now!

609
00:57:02,173 --> 00:57:04,209
- (groaning)
- Shh!

610
00:57:04,453 --> 00:57:07,251
Easy! Easy!

611
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:10,166
It's gonna be OK. It's all right.
You're gonna be OK.

612
00:57:10,253 --> 00:57:12,767
Shh, shh, shh!

613
00:57:12,853 --> 00:57:14,605
Easy.

614
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:16,764
Easy.

615
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,847
- What's her name again?
- Rebecca.

616
00:57:52,933 --> 00:57:56,243
Now think, Rebecca. Concentrate.

617
00:57:57,013 --> 00:57:59,163
Just start at the beginning.

618
00:57:59,253 --> 00:58:01,448
Where are your parents?

619
00:58:02,013 --> 00:58:03,651
Look, Rebecca...

620
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:07,203
Gorman, give it a rest, why don't you?

621
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,530
Total brainlock.

622
00:58:12,613 --> 00:58:17,323
Physically she's OK. Borderline malnutrition,
but no permanent damage.

623
00:58:17,413 --> 00:58:19,483
Come on. We're wasting our time.

624
00:58:28,813 --> 00:58:30,166
Try this.

625
00:58:31,453 --> 00:58:33,284
It's a little hot chocolate.

626
00:58:34,533 --> 00:58:36,330
There you go.

627
00:58:37,293 --> 00:58:39,284
Whoop.

628
00:58:39,773 --> 00:58:41,729
That good, huh?

629
00:58:45,853 --> 00:58:46,842
Uh-oh.

630
00:58:47,093 --> 00:58:49,084
I made a clean spot here.

631
00:58:49,173 --> 00:58:52,370
Now I've done it!
Guess I'll have to do the whole thing.

632
00:59:01,653 --> 00:59:05,487
Hard to believe there's
a little girl under all this.

633
00:59:06,253 --> 00:59:08,084
And a pretty one, too.

634
00:59:13,773 --> 00:59:15,411
You don't talk much, do you?

635
00:59:24,333 --> 00:59:28,212
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Just tell me what you're scanning for.

636
00:59:28,293 --> 00:59:34,163
PDT's. Personal data transmitters.
Every colonist had one surgically implanted.

637
00:59:34,253 --> 00:59:37,245
If they're within 20 clicks,
we'll read it out here.

638
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:39,449
So far, zippo.

639
00:59:39,533 --> 00:59:44,732
I don't know how you managed to stay alive,
but you're one brave kid, Rebecca.

640
00:59:47,493 --> 00:59:48,482
Newt.

641
00:59:50,813 --> 00:59:53,486
- What did you say?
- Newt.

642
00:59:53,573 --> 00:59:55,848
My name's Newt.

643
00:59:55,933 --> 00:59:57,924
Nobody calls me Rebecca...

644
00:59:58,013 --> 01:00:00,004
..except my brother.

645
01:00:01,013 --> 01:00:02,446
Newt.

646
01:00:03,013 --> 01:00:04,651
I like that.

647
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:05,762
I'm Ripley.

648
01:00:06,653 --> 01:00:08,484
It's nice to meet you.

649
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,048
And who is this? Hm?

650
01:00:13,733 --> 01:00:15,166
Casey.

651
01:00:15,773 --> 01:00:17,047
Hello, Casey.

652
01:00:17,133 --> 01:00:20,011
What about your brother? What's his name?

653
01:00:20,093 --> 01:00:21,731
Timmy.

654
01:00:22,413 --> 01:00:26,452
Is Timmy around here, too?
Maybe hiding like you were?

655
01:00:29,173 --> 01:00:31,164
Any sisters?

656
01:00:35,213 --> 01:00:36,532
Mom and Dad?

657
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:42,170
Newt, look at me.

658
01:00:42,253 --> 01:00:46,326
- Where are they?
- They're dead, all right? Can I go now?

659
01:00:49,333 --> 01:00:51,130
I'm sorry, Newt.

660
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:54,205
Don't you think you'd be safer here with us?

661
01:00:57,533 --> 01:00:59,888
These people are here to protect you.

662
01:00:59,973 --> 01:01:01,884
They're soldiers.

663
01:01:01,973 --> 01:01:04,646
It won't make any difference.

664
01:01:16,573 --> 01:01:18,564
Need anything else?

665
01:01:21,973 --> 01:01:24,806
Hello, Bishop. Do you need anything else?

666
01:01:26,813 --> 01:01:28,007
No.

667
01:01:30,573 --> 01:01:32,609
Nice pet you got there.

668
01:01:32,693 --> 01:01:34,365
Magnificent, isn't it?

669
01:01:36,424 --> 01:01:39,018
Yo! Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!

670
01:01:39,144 --> 01:01:40,463
Found 'em.

671
01:01:40,544 --> 01:01:41,659
They alive?

672
01:01:41,744 --> 01:01:44,895
Unknown, but it looks like all of 'em,...

673
01:01:44,984 --> 01:01:47,259
..over at the processing station,...

674
01:01:47,344 --> 01:01:48,982
..sub-level three,...

675
01:01:49,064 --> 01:01:51,373
..under the main cooling towers.

676
01:01:51,464 --> 01:01:55,093
It looks like a goddamn town meeting.

677
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:57,300
Let's saddle up, Apone.

678
01:01:57,384 --> 01:01:58,897
Aye, sir.

679
01:01:59,424 --> 01:02:02,814
Let's go, people.
They ain't payin' us by the hour.

680
01:02:02,904 --> 01:02:05,816
Head 'em out!
OK, Frost, you're driving.

681
01:02:17,144 --> 01:02:20,420
It's OK. Don't worry. It'll be OK.

682
01:02:58,704 --> 01:03:01,537
(Gorman) I want a straight V deployment.

683
01:03:01,624 --> 01:03:03,455
Second team on left flank.

684
01:03:03,664 --> 01:03:05,734
Advance on axial six-six-four.

685
01:03:06,504 --> 01:03:10,133
Tracker on-line.
Set the V-gain to fiilter R-F ambient.

686
01:03:10,224 --> 01:03:14,012
(Apone) Hudson, tracker on-line.
Left and right, little buddy.

687
01:03:15,544 --> 01:03:19,093
40 metres in, bearing two-two-one,
there should be a stairwell.

688
01:03:19,824 --> 01:03:21,416
(Apone) Check. Got it.

689
01:03:23,104 --> 01:03:25,538
(Gorman) You want sub-level three.

690
01:03:26,824 --> 01:03:31,375
(Apone) Let's go, people. Hudson,
you got the point. Hicks, watch our tails.

691
01:03:31,464 --> 01:03:34,422
Nice and easy. Check those corners.

692
01:03:35,184 --> 01:03:37,175
Check those corners.

693
01:03:39,664 --> 01:03:41,655
Watch your spacing.

694
01:03:41,744 --> 01:03:44,497
(Apone) You heard the man. Don't bunch up.

695
01:03:44,584 --> 01:03:47,052
Your transmission's showing break-up.

696
01:03:47,144 --> 01:03:51,137
(Hudson) Probably getting
interference from the structure.

697
01:03:51,224 --> 01:03:53,215
(Apone) Use those lights.

698
01:03:53,784 --> 01:03:57,572
(Gorman) Next one down,
and proceed on a two-one-six.

699
01:03:57,664 --> 01:03:59,700
(Apone) Roger, that's a two-one-six.

700
01:04:00,744 --> 01:04:04,896
(Gorman) I'm not making that out too well.
What is it, Hudson?

701
01:04:04,984 --> 01:04:07,578
You tell me, man. I only work here.

702
01:04:22,744 --> 01:04:24,143
What is that?

703
01:04:25,304 --> 01:04:26,339
I don't know.

704
01:04:27,504 --> 01:04:29,176
Proceed inside.

705
01:04:45,504 --> 01:04:48,496
(Apone) Watch your fiire
and check your targets.

706
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:51,576
Remember we're looking for civvies in here.

707
01:05:00,264 --> 01:05:01,458
Easy.

708
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:05,139
(Hicks) Tighten it up, Frost.
We're getting a little thin.

709
01:05:05,784 --> 01:05:07,775
(Apone) Nice and easy.

710
01:05:09,024 --> 01:05:12,016
Looks like some sort of secreted resin.

711
01:05:12,104 --> 01:05:15,779
Yeah... but secreted from what?

712
01:05:15,864 --> 01:05:18,424
Nobody touch nothing.

713
01:05:19,184 --> 01:05:21,334
Busy little creatures, huh?

714
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:25,420
- Hot as hell in here.
- Yeah, man, but it's a dry heat.

715
01:05:25,704 --> 01:05:27,820
Knock it off, Hudson.

716
01:05:35,024 --> 01:05:40,576
- Lieutenant, what do those pulse rifles fire?
- Ten-millimetre explosive-tip caseless.

717
01:05:40,664 --> 01:05:44,782
- Standard light armour-piercing round. Why?
- Look where your team is.

718
01:05:44,864 --> 01:05:48,220
They're right under
the primary heat exchangers.

719
01:05:48,304 --> 01:05:49,020
So?

720
01:05:49,944 --> 01:05:54,460
So, if they fire their weapons in there,
won't they rupture the cooling system?

721
01:05:54,544 --> 01:05:57,775
- Yeah. She's absolutely right.
- So what?

722
01:05:57,864 --> 01:06:01,937
This whole station is basically
a big fusion reactor.

723
01:06:02,864 --> 01:06:04,138
Right?

724
01:06:04,344 --> 01:06:08,815
So she's talking about a thermonuclear
explosion and "Adios, muchachos".

725
01:06:08,904 --> 01:06:11,464
Oh, great. Wonderful.

726
01:06:12,504 --> 01:06:14,062
Shit!

727
01:06:16,304 --> 01:06:17,373
Look.

728
01:06:17,464 --> 01:06:19,773
Uh... Apone.

729
01:06:21,024 --> 01:06:22,139
Look.

730
01:06:22,744 --> 01:06:27,977
We can't have any firing in there. I want
you to collect magazines from everybody.

731
01:06:28,064 --> 01:06:31,943
- Is he fuckin' crazy?
- What do we use? Harsh language?

732
01:06:32,024 --> 01:06:34,936
- (Gorman) Flame units only.
- Sir, l...

733
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:37,697
Just do it, Sergeant. And no grenades.

734
01:06:39,304 --> 01:06:43,217
All right, sweethearts. You heard the man.
Let's have 'em.

735
01:06:44,544 --> 01:06:47,104
Come on, Vasquez. Clear and lock.

736
01:06:50,024 --> 01:06:51,742
Damn!

737
01:06:52,104 --> 01:06:54,015
You, too. Give it up, Ski.

738
01:06:54,104 --> 01:06:56,493
Crowe, I want it now. Give it up.

739
01:06:56,864 --> 01:06:58,855
(Drake) Right on, Vas.

740
01:07:00,304 --> 01:07:03,899
Let's go, Marine. Give it up.
Frost, you got the duty. Open that bag.

741
01:07:03,984 --> 01:07:06,737
- Thanks a lot, Sarge.
- Hicks, cover our ass.

742
01:07:06,824 --> 01:07:08,655
Head 'em out, people.

743
01:07:10,784 --> 01:07:14,572
I like to keep this handy,
for close encounters.

744
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:16,063
I heard that.

745
01:07:24,424 --> 01:07:26,540
(Gorman) Any movement?

746
01:07:26,624 --> 01:07:29,092
(Hudson) Nothing. Zip.

747
01:07:41,744 --> 01:07:43,416
Holy shit!

748
01:07:56,304 --> 01:07:58,295
(Ripley) Newt, go sit up front.

749
01:07:58,384 --> 01:07:59,578
Go on!

750
01:07:59,664 --> 01:08:00,858
Now!

751
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,902
(Apone) Steady, people.
Let's fiinish our sweep.

752
01:08:31,824 --> 01:08:35,453
We're still Marines, and we got ajob to do.
Keep it moving.

753
01:08:36,704 --> 01:08:37,898
Easy.

754
01:09:08,984 --> 01:09:10,099
- Top!
- What?

755
01:09:10,184 --> 01:09:11,776
We got a live one!

756
01:09:11,864 --> 01:09:15,937
- You're gonna be all right.
- Please... kill me.

757
01:09:16,024 --> 01:09:17,855
Stay calm. We'll get you out.

758
01:09:17,984 --> 01:09:19,975
It's gonna be all right.

759
01:09:20,064 --> 01:09:22,862
- We've got to get her out!
- What is it, Dietrich?

760
01:09:22,944 --> 01:09:23,740
Convulsion!

761
01:09:24,704 --> 01:09:25,454
Ohh!

762
01:09:25,544 --> 01:09:27,660
Dietrich, get back! Get back!

763
01:09:27,744 --> 01:09:28,620
Aagh!

764
01:09:28,744 --> 01:09:30,143
Aagh!

765
01:09:35,824 --> 01:09:36,779
No!

766
01:09:37,024 --> 01:09:38,696
(Apone) Frost, flamethrower!

767
01:09:38,784 --> 01:09:41,344
Get back! Flamethrower! Move!

768
01:09:41,824 --> 01:09:43,098
(screeching)

769
01:10:09,904 --> 01:10:11,542
- (beeping)
- Movement!

770
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:14,013
What's the position?

771
01:10:14,144 --> 01:10:16,180
I can't lock in!

772
01:10:16,264 --> 01:10:18,539
Talk to me, Hudson!

773
01:10:18,624 --> 01:10:21,661
Multiple signals!

774
01:10:21,744 --> 01:10:23,780
They're closing!

775
01:10:23,864 --> 01:10:26,059
Go to infrared, people.

776
01:10:26,144 --> 01:10:27,020
Look sharp!

777
01:10:27,104 --> 01:10:30,221
What's happening, Apone?
We can't see anything in here.

778
01:10:30,304 --> 01:10:32,260
Pull your team out, Gorman.

779
01:10:37,824 --> 01:10:40,463
I got readings in front and behind!

780
01:10:40,544 --> 01:10:41,693
Where, man?

781
01:10:41,784 --> 01:10:42,899
I don't see shit.

782
01:10:42,984 --> 01:10:45,134
He's right. There's nothing back here.

783
01:10:45,224 --> 01:10:47,579
Something's moving and it ain't us!

784
01:10:49,104 --> 01:10:50,423
Shit!

785
01:10:50,504 --> 01:10:55,578
(Hudson) Tracker's off-scale, man.
They're all around us, man! Jesus!

786
01:10:56,144 --> 01:10:59,022
Maybe they don't show up on infrared at all.

787
01:11:02,624 --> 01:11:03,500
Aagh!

788
01:11:05,624 --> 01:11:06,898
Aagh!

789
01:11:08,184 --> 01:11:09,253
Frost!

790
01:11:09,344 --> 01:11:10,060
Aagh!

791
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:16,535
Come on!

792
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:22,741
Aagh!

793
01:11:23,344 --> 01:11:25,733
Jesus Christ, Apone! What is going on!

794
01:11:25,824 --> 01:11:28,179
(Hicks) Wierzbowski and Crowe are down!

795
01:11:28,264 --> 01:11:31,097
Dietrich! Crowe! Sound off!

796
01:11:31,184 --> 01:11:32,139
Frost!

797
01:11:33,464 --> 01:11:34,692
Frost!

798
01:11:36,024 --> 01:11:37,696
(Wierzbowski screams)

799
01:11:37,784 --> 01:11:39,137
Wierzbowski!

800
01:11:39,904 --> 01:11:40,893
Wierzbowski!

801
01:11:43,504 --> 01:11:44,937
(Vasquez) Let's rock!

802
01:11:45,024 --> 01:11:46,013
(Drake) Yeah!

803
01:11:46,584 --> 01:11:47,858
(gunfiire)

804
01:11:48,664 --> 01:11:50,143
Who's firing? Goddamn it!

805
01:11:52,384 --> 01:11:54,375
I ordered a "hold fire".

806
01:11:55,264 --> 01:11:58,620
They're coming out of
the goddamn walls in swarms!

807
01:11:58,704 --> 01:12:03,539
Uh, Apone, I want you to lay down
a suppressing fire with...

808
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:06,184
(Apone) Vasquez! Drake! Hold your fire!

809
01:12:06,264 --> 01:12:10,098
(Gorman) Are you copying me?
Lay down a suppressing fiire...

810
01:12:10,184 --> 01:12:11,936
..with the incinerators,
and fall back by squads.

811
01:12:12,024 --> 01:12:14,982
Say again? All after incinerators.

812
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:19,615
Lay down a suppressing fire
with the incinerators, and fall back...

813
01:12:20,104 --> 01:12:22,095
(gunfiire)

814
01:12:22,984 --> 01:12:24,019
Aagh!

815
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:26,413
Sarge!

816
01:12:26,504 --> 01:12:27,857
Apone,...

817
01:12:27,944 --> 01:12:29,502
..talk to me.

818
01:12:29,584 --> 01:12:30,573
Apone?

819
01:12:30,664 --> 01:12:32,814
- Talk to me!
- He's gone!

820
01:12:32,904 --> 01:12:34,383
(gunfiire)

821
01:12:34,464 --> 01:12:36,773
Get them out of there! Now!

822
01:12:36,864 --> 01:12:39,822
- Shut up!
- Hicks, whoever's left, get the hell...

823
01:12:39,904 --> 01:12:41,622
- Shut up!
- Goddamn it!

824
01:12:43,104 --> 01:12:45,937
(Hicks) Where's Apone?! Where's Apone?!

825
01:12:46,024 --> 01:12:49,016
The Sarge is gone!
Let's get the fuck out ofhere!

826
01:12:49,304 --> 01:12:51,215
(Hicks) Let's go, Marines!

827
01:12:51,984 --> 01:12:53,053
Hudson?

828
01:12:53,144 --> 01:12:55,021
Vasquez?

829
01:12:55,744 --> 01:12:58,099
- Hudson, look out!
- Get it!

830
01:12:59,664 --> 01:13:01,017
Hudson!

831
01:13:01,104 --> 01:13:03,902
- Hicks! Hicks!
- It's too much! Fall back!

832
01:13:03,984 --> 01:13:05,656
I told them to fall back.

833
01:13:05,744 --> 01:13:08,736
- I told them to fall back.
- They're cut off!

834
01:13:09,184 --> 01:13:10,742
Do something!

835
01:13:11,424 --> 01:13:12,334
Fuck!

836
01:13:12,744 --> 01:13:13,859
(Hicks) Keep movin'!

837
01:13:13,944 --> 01:13:15,013
Hold on, Newt.

838
01:13:21,144 --> 01:13:23,783
Ripley, what the hell are you doing!

839
01:13:29,944 --> 01:13:31,616
(Gorman) Turn around!

840
01:13:34,824 --> 01:13:36,143
That's an order!

841
01:13:40,464 --> 01:13:43,774
- (Ripley) Get off me!
- (Gorman) Goddamn it, that's an order!

842
01:13:43,864 --> 01:13:46,503
You had your chance, Gorman.

843
01:13:57,584 --> 01:13:59,176
Come on!

844
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:01,782
(Vasquez) Come on, Drake!

845
01:14:17,944 --> 01:14:19,423
(Hicks) Let's move it!

846
01:14:20,544 --> 01:14:22,819
(Vasquez) Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

847
01:14:23,264 --> 01:14:26,176
(Hudson) It's blocked, man!
We got to go around!

848
01:14:26,264 --> 01:14:27,936
Open the door! Hicks!

849
01:14:28,024 --> 01:14:30,618
Drake! We are leaving!

850
01:14:30,904 --> 01:14:32,337
Get them, Vas!

851
01:14:34,064 --> 01:14:35,338
Run for it!

852
01:14:37,224 --> 01:14:38,373
Shit!

853
01:14:42,744 --> 01:14:45,338
- Let's go!
- Drake, come on, man!

854
01:14:53,104 --> 01:14:54,742
Drake, come on!

855
01:14:57,864 --> 01:14:58,660
Aagh!

856
01:14:59,264 --> 01:15:01,414
- Aaaghhh...!
- No...!

857
01:15:03,384 --> 01:15:05,136
(Hudson) Fire in the hold!

858
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:07,977
- He's gone!
- No! Drake's out there!

859
01:15:08,064 --> 01:15:09,577
Put it out!

860
01:15:09,664 --> 01:15:11,495
Drake's coming!

861
01:15:11,584 --> 01:15:13,017
He's gone!

862
01:15:13,104 --> 01:15:14,583
No, he's... not!

863
01:15:15,944 --> 01:15:17,821
Forget him! He's gone!

864
01:15:23,424 --> 01:15:25,415
Get on the goddamn door!

865
01:15:28,544 --> 01:15:29,499
Eat this!

866
01:15:31,224 --> 01:15:32,100
Aagh!

867
01:15:33,744 --> 01:15:36,497
(Hicks) Ripley! Go, go, go!

868
01:15:46,064 --> 01:15:46,860
Whoa!

869
01:15:46,944 --> 01:15:47,740
Oh!

870
01:16:37,064 --> 01:16:39,498
It's all right! We're clear!

871
01:16:39,584 --> 01:16:43,020
Ripley, you've blown the transaxle!
You're just grinding metal!

872
01:16:43,104 --> 01:16:44,696
Come on, ease down.

873
01:16:45,544 --> 01:16:46,579
Ease down.

874
01:16:47,184 --> 01:16:48,742
Ease down!

875
01:16:49,784 --> 01:16:50,819
Ease down.

876
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:04,214
- (coughing)
- You OK?

877
01:17:05,464 --> 01:17:07,455
I'm all right.

878
01:17:07,624 --> 01:17:09,615
Get away from me, man!

879
01:17:10,304 --> 01:17:13,102
- Lieutenant.
- What happened to Gorman?

880
01:17:13,184 --> 01:17:16,096
I don't know... Maybe a concussion.

881
01:17:16,584 --> 01:17:18,893
- But he's alive.
- No, man, he's dead!

882
01:17:18,984 --> 01:17:22,579
- Wake up, pendejo! I'm gonna kill you!
- Back off!

883
01:17:22,664 --> 01:17:24,495
Right now.

884
01:17:26,504 --> 01:17:28,734
Somebody get me a first-aid kit.

885
01:17:28,824 --> 01:17:31,019
Hey. Hey, look!

886
01:17:31,544 --> 01:17:36,902
The Sarge and Dietrich aren't dead, man.
Their signs are real low, but they ain't dead.

887
01:17:36,984 --> 01:17:40,499
- Then we go back in there and get them.
- I ain't going back!

888
01:17:40,584 --> 01:17:42,461
You can't help them!

889
01:17:44,064 --> 01:17:48,535
You can't. Right now they're
being cocooned just like the others.

890
01:17:52,944 --> 01:17:56,414
Oh, dear Lord Jesus,
this ain't happenin', man.

891
01:17:56,504 --> 01:17:59,780
This can't be happenin', man.
This isn't happenin'!

892
01:17:59,984 --> 01:18:03,181
We've got seven canisters of CN-20.

893
01:18:03,264 --> 01:18:06,779
I say we roll them in there
and nerve-gas the whole fuckin' nest.

894
01:18:06,864 --> 01:18:09,856
It's worth a try, but we
don't know if it'll affect 'em.

895
01:18:09,944 --> 01:18:13,778
Let's bug out and call it even.
Why even talk about it?

896
01:18:13,864 --> 01:18:17,300
I say we take off and
nuke the entire site from orbit.

897
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:21,895
It's the only way to be sure.

898
01:18:21,984 --> 01:18:25,101
- Fuckin' A!
- Hold on one second.

899
01:18:25,184 --> 01:18:29,177
This installation has a substantial
dollar value attached to it.

900
01:18:29,264 --> 01:18:30,583
They can bill me.

901
01:18:32,184 --> 01:18:33,333
OK, look.

902
01:18:33,424 --> 01:18:37,542
This is an emotional moment
for all of us, OK? I know that.

903
01:18:37,624 --> 01:18:40,263
But let's not make snap judgments, please.

904
01:18:40,344 --> 01:18:43,461
This is clearly an important species
we're dealing with,...

905
01:18:43,544 --> 01:18:46,820
..and I don't think anybody
has the right to arbitrarily...

906
01:18:46,904 --> 01:18:48,622
- ..exterminate them.
- Wrong.

907
01:18:48,704 --> 01:18:50,183
Yeah. Watch us.

908
01:18:50,264 --> 01:18:55,099
Maybe you aren't up on current events,
but we just got our asses kicked, pal!

909
01:18:55,184 --> 01:18:58,938
Look, I'm not blind to what's going on,...

910
01:18:59,024 --> 01:19:02,096
..but I cannot authorise that kind of action.

911
01:19:04,344 --> 01:19:08,895
Well, I believe Corporal Hicks
has authority here.

912
01:19:10,184 --> 01:19:12,175
Corporal Hicks is...

913
01:19:12,264 --> 01:19:15,461
This operation is under military jurisdiction.

914
01:19:15,544 --> 01:19:19,093
Hicks is next in chain of command.
Am I right, Corporal?

915
01:19:19,184 --> 01:19:20,981
Yeah.

916
01:19:21,864 --> 01:19:24,094
Yeah, that's right.

917
01:19:24,184 --> 01:19:28,974
Yeah. Look, Ripley, this is
a multimillion-dollar installation, OK?

918
01:19:29,064 --> 01:19:31,976
He can't make that decision. He's just a grunt.

919
01:19:32,064 --> 01:19:33,053
No offence.

920
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:34,816
None taken.

921
01:19:35,024 --> 01:19:37,219
- Ferro, do you copy?
- Standing by.

922
01:19:37,304 --> 01:19:41,092
- Prep for dust-off. We need immediate evac.
- Roger. On our way.

923
01:19:41,224 --> 01:19:45,854
I say we take off... nuke the site from orbit.
It's the only way to be sure.

924
01:19:48,464 --> 01:19:50,056
Let's do it.

925
01:19:52,104 --> 01:19:54,095
(wind howling)

926
01:19:57,144 --> 01:20:00,773
Let's go! Pick it up, Hudson.
Pick it up, baby.

927
01:20:05,584 --> 01:20:07,620
All right. Set him down here.

928
01:20:13,624 --> 01:20:15,615
Move it, Spunkmeyer. We're rolling.

929
01:20:20,264 --> 01:20:22,778
Hold on a second. There's something...

930
01:20:22,864 --> 01:20:24,855
Just get up here.

931
01:20:25,064 --> 01:20:27,180
I'm in. Ramp closing.

932
01:20:46,504 --> 01:20:47,823
Spunkmeyer.

933
01:20:49,264 --> 01:20:50,333
Goddamn it.

934
01:20:50,584 --> 01:20:52,814
(door slides open)

935
01:20:53,104 --> 01:20:54,981
Well, where the fuck...

936
01:21:07,184 --> 01:21:07,821
Run!

937
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:51,980
Well, that's great.
That's just fuckin' great, man.

938
01:21:52,184 --> 01:21:56,814
Now what the fuck are we supposed to do?
We're in some real pretty shit now, man!

939
01:21:56,904 --> 01:21:58,974
Are you finished?

940
01:22:01,864 --> 01:22:03,661
You all right?

941
01:22:08,624 --> 01:22:12,139
I guess we're not
gonna be leaving now, right?

942
01:22:12,424 --> 01:22:14,415
I'm sorry, Newt.

943
01:22:14,504 --> 01:22:17,177
You don't have to be sorry.
It wasn't your fault.

944
01:22:17,264 --> 01:22:20,540
That's it, man. Game over, man! Game over!

945
01:22:20,624 --> 01:22:23,343
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
What are we gonna do?!

946
01:22:23,424 --> 01:22:27,337
Maybe we could build a fire, sing
a couple of songs. Why don't we try that?

947
01:22:27,424 --> 01:22:31,895
We'd better get back cos it'll be dark soon,
and they mostly come at night.

948
01:22:31,984 --> 01:22:33,702
Mostly.

949
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:51,335
That's everything, right?

950
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:56,214
This is absolutely everything
we could salvage out of the APC wreckage.

951
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:59,501
We got four pulse rifles
with about 50 rounds each.

952
01:22:59,584 --> 01:23:01,575
That ain't so good.

953
01:23:02,184 --> 01:23:05,460
We got 15 of these M-40 grenades.

954
01:23:05,544 --> 01:23:07,535
Don't touch that.

955
01:23:07,624 --> 01:23:09,137
Dangerous, honey.

956
01:23:09,224 --> 01:23:13,934
- Is that the only flamethrower?
- Yeah. It's only half full, but it's functional.

957
01:23:14,024 --> 01:23:17,653
And another one's damaged.
I don't know about that one.

958
01:23:18,464 --> 01:23:19,692
But the good news...

959
01:23:20,384 --> 01:23:23,262
We got four of these robot sentries...

960
01:23:23,344 --> 01:23:26,256
..with display and scanners intact.

961
01:23:26,344 --> 01:23:28,938
They really kick ass. They'll come in handy.

962
01:23:29,024 --> 01:23:32,812
How long after we're declared overdue
can we expect a rescue?

963
01:23:36,144 --> 01:23:37,736
17 days.

964
01:23:38,504 --> 01:23:40,495
17 days?

965
01:23:40,584 --> 01:23:44,896
Hey, man, I don't wanna rain on your parade,
but we're not gonna last 17 hours!

966
01:23:44,984 --> 01:23:48,499
Those things are gonna come in here
like they did before, and...

967
01:23:48,584 --> 01:23:50,700
Hudson! Hudson!

968
01:23:51,624 --> 01:23:56,493
This little girl survived longer than that
with no weapons and no training.

969
01:23:56,584 --> 01:23:57,573
Right?

970
01:24:00,784 --> 01:24:04,538
- Why don't you put her in charge?
- You better start dealing with it, Hudson.

971
01:24:04,624 --> 01:24:08,333
Listen to me.
Deal with it, because we need you...

972
01:24:08,424 --> 01:24:10,415
..and I'm sick of your bullshit.

973
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:14,736
Now get on a terminal and call up
a floor-plan file. Do you understand?

974
01:24:14,824 --> 01:24:18,817
Construction blueprints. Anything that
shows the layout. Are you listening?

975
01:24:18,904 --> 01:24:20,417
Yeah.

976
01:24:20,624 --> 01:24:25,175
I need to see air ducts, electrical
access tunnels, sub-basements,...

977
01:24:25,264 --> 01:24:27,903
..every possible way into this complex.

978
01:24:28,904 --> 01:24:30,656
We don't have much time.

979
01:24:30,744 --> 01:24:32,336
OK.

980
01:24:33,504 --> 01:24:35,495
- OK, I'm on it.
- Hudson...

981
01:24:35,584 --> 01:24:37,256
Just relax.

982
01:24:42,904 --> 01:24:44,781
I'll be in med lab.

983
01:24:44,864 --> 01:24:48,174
I'll check on Gorman, continue my analysis.

984
01:24:48,264 --> 01:24:49,174
Fine.

985
01:24:49,864 --> 01:24:51,183
You do that.

986
01:24:57,024 --> 01:25:00,699
So this service tunnel must be
how they're moving back and forth.

987
01:25:00,784 --> 01:25:05,096
Right. It moves from the processing
station right into the sub-level here.

988
01:25:06,624 --> 01:25:08,615
Come down on that.

989
01:25:08,704 --> 01:25:10,501
OK, come over.

990
01:25:10,984 --> 01:25:13,976
Hold it. Go back.
OK, punch that in right there.

991
01:25:19,104 --> 01:25:21,254
- No. It's back here.
- OK.

992
01:25:22,704 --> 01:25:25,264
Well, there's a pressure door at this end.

993
01:25:25,344 --> 01:25:28,814
Couldn't we put a remote
sentry unit in the tunnel...

994
01:25:28,904 --> 01:25:32,738
- ..and then seal that door?
- But we gotta figure on them getting in.

995
01:25:32,824 --> 01:25:34,860
That's right, so...

996
01:25:34,944 --> 01:25:38,493
..we repair the barricades
at these two intersections...

997
01:25:38,584 --> 01:25:42,896
..and weld plate steel
over these ducts here, and here,...

998
01:25:42,984 --> 01:25:44,178
..and here.

999
01:25:44,784 --> 01:25:47,696
Then they can only come at us
from these two corridors.

1000
01:25:47,784 --> 01:25:51,413
Right. Then we put
the other sentry units here...

1001
01:25:51,504 --> 01:25:53,096
..and here. Right?

1002
01:25:53,184 --> 01:25:55,175
- Right.
- Outstanding.

1003
01:25:55,264 --> 01:25:57,539
Now all we need is a deck of cards.

1004
01:25:59,144 --> 01:26:01,738
All right, let's move
like we've got a purpose.

1005
01:26:01,824 --> 01:26:04,463
- Affirmative.
- Affirmative.

1006
01:26:19,104 --> 01:26:20,822
Do your thing, baby.

1007
01:26:20,904 --> 01:26:23,213
Vasquez, let's get the hell out of here.

1008
01:26:23,304 --> 01:26:26,614
- A and B sentries are in place and keyed.
- Roger.

1009
01:26:26,704 --> 01:26:28,740
Stand by. Arming now.

1010
01:26:28,824 --> 01:26:30,223
Test it, Hudson.

1011
01:26:30,304 --> 01:26:32,613
- Do it!
- Fire in the hole!

1012
01:26:35,864 --> 01:26:38,617
OK! Let's get the hell out of here!

1013
01:26:38,704 --> 01:26:40,695
We're sealing the tunnel!

1014
01:26:40,784 --> 01:26:41,773
Come on, baby.

1015
01:26:53,464 --> 01:26:55,455
For what it's worth...

1016
01:26:57,104 --> 01:26:59,379
Here, I want you to put this on.

1017
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:01,580
What's it for?

1018
01:27:01,664 --> 01:27:06,294
It's a locator. Then I can find you
anywhere in the complex... on this.

1019
01:27:07,984 --> 01:27:09,975
It's just a precaution.

1020
01:27:10,304 --> 01:27:11,703
Thanks.

1021
01:27:12,104 --> 01:27:14,698
Doesn't mean we're engaged or anything.

1022
01:27:14,784 --> 01:27:16,695
All right, what's next?

1023
01:27:45,024 --> 01:27:46,503
Last stop.

1024
01:27:51,104 --> 01:27:52,503
Get in.

1025
01:27:52,904 --> 01:27:54,132
Scoot down.

1026
01:27:55,464 --> 01:27:56,738
That's good.

1027
01:27:56,824 --> 01:27:59,133
Now you lie here and have a nap.

1028
01:27:59,224 --> 01:28:00,703
You're very tired.

1029
01:28:00,784 --> 01:28:04,015
I don't want to. I have scary dreams.

1030
01:28:06,304 --> 01:28:09,057
Well, I bet Casey doesn't have scary dreams.

1031
01:28:09,344 --> 01:28:10,857
Let's take a look.

1032
01:28:11,384 --> 01:28:13,500
Nope. Nothing bad in there.

1033
01:28:13,584 --> 01:28:14,733
See?

1034
01:28:14,944 --> 01:28:17,299
Maybe you could just try to be like her.

1035
01:28:17,864 --> 01:28:20,458
Ripley, she doesn't have bad dreams...

1036
01:28:20,544 --> 01:28:23,183
..because she's just a piece of plastic.

1037
01:28:23,264 --> 01:28:24,538
Right.

1038
01:28:24,944 --> 01:28:26,696
I'm sorry, Newt.

1039
01:28:33,064 --> 01:28:34,133
There.

1040
01:28:35,424 --> 01:28:39,303
My mommy always said there
were no monsters. No real ones.

1041
01:28:39,384 --> 01:28:41,340
But there are.

1042
01:28:41,424 --> 01:28:44,461
Yes, there are, aren't there?

1043
01:28:46,144 --> 01:28:48,783
Why do they tell little kids that?

1044
01:28:50,384 --> 01:28:52,375
Most of the time it's true.

1045
01:28:52,464 --> 01:28:55,774
Did one of those things grow inside her?

1046
01:28:55,864 --> 01:28:58,332
I don't know, Newt.

1047
01:28:58,424 --> 01:29:00,494
That's the truth.

1048
01:29:00,584 --> 01:29:02,973
Isn't that how babies come?

1049
01:29:03,064 --> 01:29:05,055
I mean, people babies?

1050
01:29:05,144 --> 01:29:08,693
- They grow inside you.
- No. That's very different.

1051
01:29:08,784 --> 01:29:10,661
Did you ever have a baby?

1052
01:29:10,744 --> 01:29:12,177
Yes, I did.

1053
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:13,697
I had a little girl.

1054
01:29:13,784 --> 01:29:15,661
Where is she?

1055
01:29:16,744 --> 01:29:18,177
She's gone.

1056
01:29:20,144 --> 01:29:21,782
You mean dead.

1057
01:29:23,344 --> 01:29:24,743
Here.

1058
01:29:26,504 --> 01:29:28,096
Take this.

1059
01:29:28,744 --> 01:29:30,336
For luck.

1060
01:29:33,424 --> 01:29:35,415
How's that?

1061
01:29:37,544 --> 01:29:39,535
Don't go! Please!

1062
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:42,184
Newt, I'm gonna be right in the next room.

1063
01:29:42,904 --> 01:29:44,895
And you see that camera?

1064
01:29:44,984 --> 01:29:47,657
I can see you through that camera,...

1065
01:29:47,744 --> 01:29:50,463
..all the time, to see if you're safe.

1066
01:29:54,184 --> 01:29:56,982
I'm not gonna leave you, Newt.

1067
01:29:57,064 --> 01:29:58,622
I mean that.

1068
01:29:58,704 --> 01:30:00,581
That's a promise.

1069
01:30:00,664 --> 01:30:02,177
You promise?

1070
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:05,496
I cross my heart.

1071
01:30:05,584 --> 01:30:07,222
And hope to die?

1072
01:30:07,304 --> 01:30:09,738
And hope to die.

1073
01:30:23,664 --> 01:30:25,336
Now go to sleep,...

1074
01:30:26,304 --> 01:30:28,295
..and don't dream.

1075
01:30:32,224 --> 01:30:33,623
Sneak.

1076
01:30:42,584 --> 01:30:46,941
The molecular acid oxidises after the
creature's death, completely neutralising.

1077
01:30:47,024 --> 01:30:50,096
Bishop, that's interesting,
but it gets us nowhere.

1078
01:30:50,184 --> 01:30:54,780
I'm trying to figure out what we're dealing
with here. Let's go through it again.

1079
01:30:54,864 --> 01:31:00,143
They grab the colonists and immobilise them
to be hosts for more of these.

1080
01:31:01,264 --> 01:31:04,540
So there would have to be
a lot of these parasites.

1081
01:31:04,624 --> 01:31:06,933
One for each colonist.
A hundred at least.

1082
01:31:07,024 --> 01:31:08,855
Yes, that follows.

1083
01:31:08,944 --> 01:31:12,619
Each one of these things
comes from an egg, right?

1084
01:31:15,144 --> 01:31:17,135
So who's laying these eggs?

1085
01:31:18,344 --> 01:31:22,098
I'm not sure.
It must be something we haven't seen yet.

1086
01:31:22,184 --> 01:31:24,573
Hey, maybe it's like an ant hive.

1087
01:31:24,664 --> 01:31:27,736
- Bees, man. Bees have hives.
- You know what I mean.

1088
01:31:27,824 --> 01:31:31,373
There's, like, one female
that runs the whole show.

1089
01:31:31,464 --> 01:31:33,739
- Yes. The queen.
- Yeah, the mama.

1090
01:31:33,824 --> 01:31:36,497
And she's badass, man. I mean big.

1091
01:31:36,584 --> 01:31:38,654
- These things ain't ants.
- I know that!

1092
01:31:39,664 --> 01:31:44,215
Bishop, I want these specimens destroyed
as soon as you're finished with them.

1093
01:31:44,304 --> 01:31:49,856
Mr Burke said they were to be kept alive
in stasis for return to the company labs.

1094
01:31:52,744 --> 01:31:55,019
He was very specific about it.

1095
01:31:55,104 --> 01:31:59,177
Those two specimens are worth millions
to the bio-weapons division.

1096
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:02,654
If you're smart, we can both
come out of this heroes,...

1097
01:32:02,744 --> 01:32:05,178
..and we will be set up for life.

1098
01:32:06,304 --> 01:32:08,898
You're crazy, Burke. Do you know that?

1099
01:32:09,024 --> 01:32:13,415
You really think you can get a dangerous
organism like that past ICC quarantine?

1100
01:32:13,504 --> 01:32:16,496
How can they impound it
if they don't know about it?

1101
01:32:16,584 --> 01:32:19,178
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.

1102
01:32:19,264 --> 01:32:23,542
Just like they'll know you were responsible
for the deaths of 157 colonists.

1103
01:32:23,624 --> 01:32:26,457
- Wait a second!
- You sent them to that ship.

1104
01:32:26,544 --> 01:32:31,743
I just checked the colony log : directive
dated 6-12-79, signed Burke, Carter J.

1105
01:32:31,824 --> 01:32:36,022
You sent them out there
and you didn't even warn them.

1106
01:32:36,104 --> 01:32:40,222
What if that ship didn't even exist?
Did you think about that? I didn't know.

1107
01:32:40,304 --> 01:32:44,422
So now if I make a major security situation
out of it, everybody steps in...

1108
01:32:44,504 --> 01:32:47,974
..and there's no exclusive rights
for anybody. Nobody wins.

1109
01:32:48,064 --> 01:32:53,422
So I made a decision and it was wrong.
It was a bad call, Ripley. A bad call.

1110
01:32:53,504 --> 01:32:58,532
Bad call? These people are dead, Burke!
Have you any idea what you've done here!

1111
01:32:58,624 --> 01:33:01,422
I'm gonna make sure
they nail you right to the wall.

1112
01:33:01,504 --> 01:33:03,938
You won't sleaze your way out of this one.

1113
01:33:04,024 --> 01:33:05,776
Right to the wall.

1114
01:33:07,504 --> 01:33:08,493
Ripley.

1115
01:33:10,584 --> 01:33:15,453
You know, I expected more from you.
I thought you'd be smarter than this.

1116
01:33:16,384 --> 01:33:18,375
I'm happy to disappoint you.

1117
01:33:25,544 --> 01:33:27,739
(alarm from robot sentries)

1118
01:33:31,464 --> 01:33:33,455
What is it? What's going on?

1119
01:33:33,544 --> 01:33:34,977
- They're coming.
- Where?

1120
01:33:35,064 --> 01:33:36,543
In the tunnel.

1121
01:33:38,024 --> 01:33:39,218
Here we go.

1122
01:33:39,304 --> 01:33:41,738
A and B gun tracking and firing.

1123
01:33:41,824 --> 01:33:43,257
Multiple targets.

1124
01:33:48,824 --> 01:33:50,655
Look at those ammo counters go.

1125
01:33:53,184 --> 01:33:55,220
B gun's down 50 per cent.

1126
01:33:56,344 --> 01:33:58,539
It's a shooting gallery down there!

1127
01:34:02,304 --> 01:34:03,976
60 rounds left on B.

1128
01:34:04,064 --> 01:34:07,101
40... 20... 10.

1129
01:34:07,184 --> 01:34:09,334
B gun's dry. 20 on A.

1130
01:34:10,544 --> 01:34:11,294
Ten...

1131
01:34:11,384 --> 01:34:12,703
..five...

1132
01:34:16,504 --> 01:34:17,778
That's it.

1133
01:34:17,864 --> 01:34:20,901
Jesus! They're wall-to-wall in there.

1134
01:34:23,184 --> 01:34:24,902
(loud thumping noises)

1135
01:34:24,984 --> 01:34:26,815
They're at the pressure door.

1136
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:30,297
Man, listen to that.

1137
01:34:30,384 --> 01:34:33,899
Bishop here. I'm afraid I have some bad news.

1138
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:35,736
Well, that's a switch!

1139
01:34:37,584 --> 01:34:40,940
It's very pretty, Bishop,
but what are we looking for?

1140
01:34:41,024 --> 01:34:44,016
That's it. Emergency venting.

1141
01:34:44,504 --> 01:34:48,656
That's beautiful, man. That beats it all.

1142
01:34:48,744 --> 01:34:50,541
How long till it blows?

1143
01:34:50,704 --> 01:34:52,535
Four hours...

1144
01:34:52,624 --> 01:34:57,061
..with a blast radius of 30 kilometres,
equal to about 40 megatons.

1145
01:34:58,104 --> 01:35:01,414
- We got problems.
- I don't fuckin' believe this!

1146
01:35:01,824 --> 01:35:03,735
Vasquez, close the shutters.

1147
01:35:03,824 --> 01:35:06,019
Why can't we shut it down from here?

1148
01:35:06,424 --> 01:35:10,736
The crash caused too much damage.
An overload was inevitable at this point.

1149
01:35:10,824 --> 01:35:15,340
Oh, man! And I was getting short!
Four more weeks and out.

1150
01:35:15,424 --> 01:35:18,780
- Now I'm gonna buy it on this rock!
- Give us a break!

1151
01:35:18,864 --> 01:35:21,332
(Hudson) Four more weeks. Oh, man!

1152
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:24,336
We need the other drop-ship from the Sulaco.

1153
01:35:24,824 --> 01:35:27,418
Can't we bring it down on remote?

1154
01:35:27,504 --> 01:35:30,894
How? The transmitter was on the APC!
It's wasted!

1155
01:35:30,984 --> 01:35:34,135
I don't care how,
but we'd better think of something!

1156
01:35:34,264 --> 01:35:36,903
Think of what?!
We're fucked! We're doomed!

1157
01:35:36,984 --> 01:35:41,455
Shut up! What about the colony transmitters?
The uplink tower at the other end?

1158
01:35:41,544 --> 01:35:45,219
The hard-wiring between
here and there was damaged.

1159
01:35:45,304 --> 01:35:47,260
We can't align the dish.

1160
01:35:47,344 --> 01:35:52,543
Somebody has to go out there. Take
a portable terminal and patch in manually.

1161
01:35:52,624 --> 01:35:57,493
Oh, yeah, sure! With those things
running around? You can count me out.

1162
01:35:57,584 --> 01:36:00,337
- We can count you out of everything.
- I'll go.

1163
01:36:00,424 --> 01:36:02,540
- (Hudson) Why don't you go, man?
- (Bishop) I'll go.

1164
01:36:02,624 --> 01:36:04,615
- What?
- I'll go.

1165
01:36:04,704 --> 01:36:07,423
I'm the only one qualified
to remote-pilot the ship.

1166
01:36:07,504 --> 01:36:10,496
(Hudson) Yeah, right, man. Bishop should go.

1167
01:36:10,584 --> 01:36:11,699
Good idea!

1168
01:36:11,784 --> 01:36:13,854
Believe me, I'd prefer not to.

1169
01:36:13,944 --> 01:36:17,778
I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid.

1170
01:36:28,104 --> 01:36:29,856
(Ripley) How long?

1171
01:36:29,944 --> 01:36:33,175
This conduit runs almost
to the uplink assembly. 180 metres.

1172
01:36:33,264 --> 01:36:36,336
- Say 40 minutes to crawl down there,...
- Right.

1173
01:36:36,424 --> 01:36:40,099
..an hour to patch in and align the antenna,...

1174
01:36:41,304 --> 01:36:45,092
..30 minutes to prep the ship,
and about 50 minutes flight time.

1175
01:36:45,184 --> 01:36:46,902
It's gonna be close.

1176
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:53,378
- Good luck.
- See you soon.

1177
01:36:54,744 --> 01:36:56,496
Watch your fingers.

1178
01:37:00,504 --> 01:37:01,857
Vaya con Dios, man.

1179
01:37:14,024 --> 01:37:16,015
This is unbelievable!

1180
01:37:16,104 --> 01:37:19,176
20 metres and closing. 15.

1181
01:37:19,264 --> 01:37:20,413
How many?

1182
01:37:20,504 --> 01:37:23,018
Can't tell. Lots.

1183
01:37:23,624 --> 01:37:25,615
D gun's down 50 per cent.

1184
01:37:29,584 --> 01:37:32,621
C gun's right behind it.

1185
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:37,501
(Hudson) It ain't stopping 'em.
It ain't stopping 'em!

1186
01:37:37,584 --> 01:37:39,779
(Hicks) 150 rounds on D.

1187
01:37:39,864 --> 01:37:41,820
(Hudson) Come on, baby. Come on!

1188
01:37:42,224 --> 01:37:42,974
100 rounds.

1189
01:37:45,864 --> 01:37:47,343
(Hudson) Come on, come on!

1190
01:37:47,424 --> 01:37:48,573
(beeping)

1191
01:37:52,104 --> 01:37:53,583
D gun's down to 20.

1192
01:37:54,984 --> 01:37:55,575
Ten.

1193
01:37:58,264 --> 01:37:59,663
Damn it!

1194
01:38:01,904 --> 01:38:02,381
Wait!

1195
01:38:02,464 --> 01:38:04,056
They're retreating.

1196
01:38:09,104 --> 01:38:11,698
(Ripley) The guns stopped them.

1197
01:38:13,904 --> 01:38:15,337
You're right.

1198
01:38:21,904 --> 01:38:24,293
Next time they walk right up and knock.

1199
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:26,454
Yeah, but they don't know that.

1200
01:38:26,584 --> 01:38:29,735
They're probably looking
for other ways to get in.

1201
01:38:29,824 --> 01:38:31,815
That'll take 'em a while.

1202
01:38:31,904 --> 01:38:34,293
- Maybe we got 'em demoralised.
- Shut up.

1203
01:38:35,744 --> 01:38:37,939
I want you two walking perimeter.

1204
01:38:39,464 --> 01:38:40,692
Move!

1205
01:38:47,984 --> 01:38:50,020
Hey, listen.

1206
01:38:50,104 --> 01:38:52,299
We're all in strung-out shape,...

1207
01:38:52,384 --> 01:38:54,375
..but stay frosty...

1208
01:38:54,464 --> 01:38:56,455
..and alert.

1209
01:38:57,504 --> 01:39:00,257
We can't afford to let
one of those bastards in here.

1210
01:39:00,344 --> 01:39:03,620
All right. Vämonos.

1211
01:39:12,104 --> 01:39:14,823
How long's it been since you got any sleep?

1212
01:39:14,904 --> 01:39:17,020
24 hours?

1213
01:39:18,544 --> 01:39:21,502
Hicks, I'm not gonna end up like those others.

1214
01:39:21,904 --> 01:39:24,372
You'll take care of it, won't you?

1215
01:39:26,104 --> 01:39:30,256
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.

1216
01:39:31,904 --> 01:39:36,056
Let's just make sure
it doesn't come to that, all right?

1217
01:39:36,144 --> 01:39:38,100
All right.

1218
01:39:38,704 --> 01:39:42,902
Hey, I want to introduce you
to a personal friend of mine.

1219
01:39:43,424 --> 01:39:46,496
This is an M-41A pulse rifle, 10 millimetre,...

1220
01:39:46,584 --> 01:39:50,782
..with an over-and-under 30 millimetre
pump-action grenade launcher.

1221
01:39:50,864 --> 01:39:52,741
Feel the weight.

1222
01:39:59,624 --> 01:40:01,580
OK. What do I do?

1223
01:40:03,824 --> 01:40:05,257
(panting)

1224
01:40:06,744 --> 01:40:09,019
Pull it in tight here.

1225
01:40:09,104 --> 01:40:11,140
- Right.
- Lean into it.

1226
01:40:12,024 --> 01:40:14,140
All right, now it will kick some.

1227
01:40:15,144 --> 01:40:18,181
When the counter reads zero here, you...

1228
01:40:18,264 --> 01:40:20,414
- I press this up?
- That's right.

1229
01:40:22,424 --> 01:40:25,018
Get another one in quick. Slap it in hard.

1230
01:40:25,104 --> 01:40:27,777
- Right.
- Now you're ready to rock 'n' roll.

1231
01:40:28,304 --> 01:40:31,421
- What's this?
- The grenade launcher.

1232
01:40:31,504 --> 01:40:33,620
I don't think you want to mess with that.

1233
01:40:33,704 --> 01:40:36,696
You started this. Show me everything.

1234
01:40:37,464 --> 01:40:39,136
I can handle myself.

1235
01:40:41,304 --> 01:40:42,817
Yeah, I noticed.

1236
01:40:52,624 --> 01:40:54,501
How do you feel?

1237
01:40:54,584 --> 01:40:57,621
All right, I guess. One hell of a hangover.

1238
01:40:59,304 --> 01:41:02,660
- Look, Ripley, I just want...
- Forget it. Excuse me.

1239
01:41:53,104 --> 01:41:54,935
(Newt moaning)

1240
01:41:55,024 --> 01:41:57,174
Shh, shh, shh.

1241
01:41:57,824 --> 01:42:00,975
It's OK. It's OK.

1242
01:43:08,344 --> 01:43:11,381
(whispers) Newt. Wake up.

1243
01:43:11,464 --> 01:43:13,295
- What?
- Be quiet.

1244
01:43:13,384 --> 01:43:15,375
We're in trouble.

1245
01:43:32,424 --> 01:43:35,257
- Agh!
- (Newt screams)

1246
01:43:35,344 --> 01:43:37,335
Move, Newt!

1247
01:43:57,384 --> 01:43:58,294
Hey!

1248
01:43:58,384 --> 01:44:00,579
(no sound through glass)

1249
01:44:06,904 --> 01:44:08,496
Help!

1250
01:44:09,384 --> 01:44:11,136
Help!

1251
01:44:11,544 --> 01:44:12,579
Hicks!

1252
01:44:13,464 --> 01:44:14,897
Say again, Bishop?

1253
01:44:14,984 --> 01:44:18,181
You've got it into auto-refuel mode
and it's sequencing right?

1254
01:44:18,264 --> 01:44:19,583
(Bishop) That's right.

1255
01:44:19,664 --> 01:44:21,222
Good. Stay on it.

1256
01:44:22,104 --> 01:44:25,619
Get back to me when you've
activated the launch cycle.

1257
01:44:26,464 --> 01:44:29,262
- He's at the uplink tower.
- Terrific.

1258
01:44:32,744 --> 01:44:35,975
- Hicks! Hicks!
- Help! Help!

1259
01:44:36,064 --> 01:44:37,543
Hicks! Help us!

1260
01:44:37,624 --> 01:44:39,182
Break the glass!

1261
01:44:39,264 --> 01:44:41,459
Break it, break it!

1262
01:44:41,544 --> 01:44:43,136
I'll try.

1263
01:45:02,784 --> 01:45:05,378
Ripley, I'm scared.

1264
01:45:06,144 --> 01:45:07,133
Me, too.

1265
01:45:12,744 --> 01:45:13,972
Stay here.

1266
01:45:22,864 --> 01:45:24,934
(alarm)

1267
01:45:26,744 --> 01:45:28,735
It's the med lab. Hudson!

1268
01:45:28,824 --> 01:45:31,736
Vasquez! Meet me in med lab! We got a fire!

1269
01:45:31,824 --> 01:45:33,815
(Hudson) We're on our way.

1270
01:45:36,784 --> 01:45:39,423
They're coming, Newt.

1271
01:45:43,824 --> 01:45:45,860
(Newt screams)

1272
01:45:45,944 --> 01:45:46,535
Urgh!

1273
01:45:53,424 --> 01:45:54,823
Aagh!

1274
01:46:01,304 --> 01:46:03,295
(screaming)

1275
01:46:10,184 --> 01:46:11,936
Shoot it out!

1276
01:46:15,784 --> 01:46:17,615
- Hudson!
- Jesus!

1277
01:46:19,464 --> 01:46:20,419
Oh!

1278
01:46:21,024 --> 01:46:23,254
Christ, kid, look out!

1279
01:46:43,144 --> 01:46:44,418
- Over there!
- Yeah!

1280
01:46:44,544 --> 01:46:45,659
- Ready?
- Yeah!

1281
01:46:50,664 --> 01:46:51,858
Hudson!

1282
01:46:51,944 --> 01:46:54,094
Yeah, all clear. Nailed the other one.

1283
01:46:54,184 --> 01:46:55,697
It's history, man.

1284
01:46:56,904 --> 01:46:57,893
Jesus!

1285
01:46:59,824 --> 01:47:02,622
Burke. It was Burke.

1286
01:47:05,304 --> 01:47:08,535
I say we grease this rat-fuck
son of a bitch right now.

1287
01:47:08,624 --> 01:47:11,263
It just doesn't make any goddamn sense.

1288
01:47:14,224 --> 01:47:18,012
He figured that he could get an alien
back through quarantine...

1289
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:20,942
..if one of us was impregnated.

1290
01:47:21,024 --> 01:47:23,140
Whatever you call it.

1291
01:47:23,984 --> 01:47:26,862
And then frozen for the trip home.

1292
01:47:26,944 --> 01:47:31,096
Nobody would know about
the embryos we were carrying,...

1293
01:47:31,184 --> 01:47:32,856
..me and Newt.

1294
01:47:34,624 --> 01:47:36,501
Wait, now. We'd all know.

1295
01:47:36,584 --> 01:47:42,022
Yes. He could only do it by sabotaging
certain freezers on the way home.

1296
01:47:42,104 --> 01:47:43,503
Namely, yours.

1297
01:47:43,584 --> 01:47:48,658
Then he could jettison the bodies
and make up any story he liked.

1298
01:47:48,744 --> 01:47:50,894
Fuck! He's dead.

1299
01:47:52,144 --> 01:47:54,135
You're dog meat, pal.

1300
01:47:54,904 --> 01:47:59,375
This is so nuts. I mean, listen...
Listen to what you're saying.

1301
01:47:59,744 --> 01:48:03,020
It's paranoid delusion. It's really sad.

1302
01:48:04,664 --> 01:48:06,302
It's pathetic.

1303
01:48:06,384 --> 01:48:09,421
Burke, I don't know which species is worse.

1304
01:48:09,504 --> 01:48:13,292
They don't fuck each other over
for a goddamn percentage.

1305
01:48:13,384 --> 01:48:16,376
All right, we waste him. No offence.

1306
01:48:16,464 --> 01:48:18,375
No! He's got to go back...

1307
01:48:19,184 --> 01:48:21,175
They cut the power.

1308
01:48:21,264 --> 01:48:24,222
How can they cut the power?
They're animals!

1309
01:48:24,304 --> 01:48:27,102
I want you two checking the corridors! Move!

1310
01:48:27,184 --> 01:48:29,857
Gorman, watch Burke.
Newt, stay close.

1311
01:48:33,224 --> 01:48:36,216
- I'll go this side.
- You do that, man.

1312
01:49:00,064 --> 01:49:02,737
- Anything?
- (Hudson) There's something.

1313
01:49:02,824 --> 01:49:05,896
- (beeping)
- It's inside the complex.

1314
01:49:05,984 --> 01:49:07,861
You're just reading me.

1315
01:49:07,944 --> 01:49:10,697
- (beeping)
- No, it ain't you.

1316
01:49:12,624 --> 01:49:16,014
They're inside the perimeter. They're in here.

1317
01:49:16,104 --> 01:49:19,096
(Ripley) Hudson, stay cool. Vasquez?

1318
01:49:24,624 --> 01:49:27,696
- (beeps louder)
- Hudson may be right.

1319
01:49:27,784 --> 01:49:30,776
- Get back, both of you.
- (Hudson) The signal's weird.

1320
01:49:32,184 --> 01:49:36,575
Must be some interference or something.
There's movement all over the place!

1321
01:49:36,664 --> 01:49:39,895
Get back to Operations. It's game time.

1322
01:49:39,984 --> 01:49:41,178
Newt.

1323
01:49:43,544 --> 01:49:45,455
Seal the door.

1324
01:49:45,544 --> 01:49:46,533
Hurry!

1325
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:49,821
(Hicks) Come on! Come on, get back!

1326
01:49:49,904 --> 01:49:51,815
Work fast.

1327
01:49:55,024 --> 01:49:58,061
Cover your eyes, Newt. Don't look at the light.

1328
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:02,342
Movement. Signal's clean. Range: 20 metres.

1329
01:50:02,424 --> 01:50:05,097
They found a way in, something we missed.

1330
01:50:05,184 --> 01:50:07,015
We didn't miss anything.

1331
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:08,696
18...

1332
01:50:08,784 --> 01:50:10,695
17 metres.

1333
01:50:10,784 --> 01:50:13,582
Something under the floor, not in the plans.

1334
01:50:13,664 --> 01:50:15,177
- 15 metres.
- Ripley!

1335
01:50:15,264 --> 01:50:17,141
Definitely inside the barricades.

1336
01:50:17,224 --> 01:50:18,623
Let's go!

1337
01:50:20,184 --> 01:50:24,621
- That's right outside the door. Get back!
- This is a big fuckin' signal.

1338
01:50:24,704 --> 01:50:27,821
- How you doing, Vasquez?
- Almost there.

1339
01:50:29,344 --> 01:50:30,823
That's it.

1340
01:50:31,704 --> 01:50:33,262
12 metres.

1341
01:50:33,784 --> 01:50:35,376
1 1 ...

1342
01:50:35,784 --> 01:50:36,773
10...

1343
01:50:36,864 --> 01:50:39,617
- They're right on us.
- 9 metres.

1344
01:50:39,704 --> 01:50:42,901
- Remember, short controlled bursts.
- 8 metres.

1345
01:50:45,464 --> 01:50:47,182
7...

1346
01:50:48,384 --> 01:50:49,453
6...

1347
01:50:49,544 --> 01:50:52,661
- That can't be!
- It's reading right, man!

1348
01:50:52,744 --> 01:50:54,223
You're not reading it right.

1349
01:50:56,664 --> 01:50:58,939
5 metres, man - 4!

1350
01:50:59,464 --> 01:51:01,455
What the hell!

1351
01:51:03,624 --> 01:51:07,094
- Oh, my God!
- Give me the light!

1352
01:51:24,664 --> 01:51:26,382
There they go! Get 'em!

1353
01:51:28,344 --> 01:51:30,904
- Come on!
- Get 'em!

1354
01:51:31,904 --> 01:51:34,020
Do something, Gorman!

1355
01:51:35,544 --> 01:51:38,741
(Hudson) Look out! Look out!
There's more of 'em!

1356
01:51:38,824 --> 01:51:40,462
Get to medical!

1357
01:51:41,104 --> 01:51:42,617
Do it! Now!

1358
01:51:42,704 --> 01:51:44,695
(Hicks) Hudson! Look out!

1359
01:51:48,464 --> 01:51:49,294
Aagh!

1360
01:51:50,024 --> 01:51:51,013
Now!

1361
01:51:52,984 --> 01:51:53,700
Burke!

1362
01:51:56,864 --> 01:52:00,015
Open this door! Burke! Open it!

1363
01:52:00,744 --> 01:52:01,654
Agh!

1364
01:52:01,784 --> 01:52:04,218
Let's go! Let's go! Fall back!

1365
01:52:07,184 --> 01:52:07,980
Go!

1366
01:52:08,224 --> 01:52:10,897
Die, motherfucker!

1367
01:52:10,984 --> 01:52:12,303
Burke!

1368
01:52:12,384 --> 01:52:13,658
Hudson!

1369
01:52:14,544 --> 01:52:15,818
Hudson!

1370
01:52:15,904 --> 01:52:17,223
Motherfucker!

1371
01:52:17,304 --> 01:52:19,943
Come on! Come on! Come and get it, baby!

1372
01:52:20,584 --> 01:52:24,259
I don't got all day! Come on, you bastard!

1373
01:52:24,344 --> 01:52:27,654
Come on, you too!
You want some of this? Fuck you!

1374
01:52:28,624 --> 01:52:29,693
Aagh!

1375
01:52:30,144 --> 01:52:32,021
Fuck you!

1376
01:52:32,904 --> 01:52:34,383
- Hicks!
- Hudson!

1377
01:52:34,464 --> 01:52:36,136
(Hudson screaming)

1378
01:52:43,104 --> 01:52:44,503
Come on, Hicks!

1379
01:52:44,584 --> 01:52:45,573
Go!

1380
01:52:45,664 --> 01:52:47,017
(Ripley) It's locked!

1381
01:53:04,864 --> 01:53:06,661
Got it! Let's go!

1382
01:53:07,304 --> 01:53:08,419
Go! Go!

1383
01:53:10,944 --> 01:53:12,172
Move, Gorman!

1384
01:53:12,264 --> 01:53:13,663
Seal it!

1385
01:53:14,704 --> 01:53:15,853
Burke!

1386
01:53:15,944 --> 01:53:18,219
Goddamn you! Open this door!

1387
01:53:27,464 --> 01:53:28,943
(Burke screams)

1388
01:53:30,304 --> 01:53:30,941
Get back!

1389
01:53:31,024 --> 01:53:33,379
- Hurry up!
- Gorman, get out of the way!

1390
01:53:33,464 --> 01:53:35,455
- Ripley, this way!
- What?

1391
01:53:36,024 --> 01:53:38,015
Wait. Get behind me.

1392
01:53:38,104 --> 01:53:40,413
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast!

1393
01:53:43,304 --> 01:53:46,023
- Hicks!
- Come on, let's go!

1394
01:53:47,784 --> 01:53:49,058
Move!

1395
01:53:55,424 --> 01:53:58,177
- Which way to the landing field?
- This way.

1396
01:54:03,384 --> 01:54:04,976
Go right!

1397
01:54:07,624 --> 01:54:10,263
This way! This way.

1398
01:54:18,544 --> 01:54:21,854
- Which way?
- Straight ahead and left.

1399
01:54:21,944 --> 01:54:25,175
Bishop, do you read me? Come in. Over.

1400
01:54:25,264 --> 01:54:27,255
(Bishop) The ship is on its way.

1401
01:54:27,344 --> 01:54:30,302
ETA 16 minutes.

1402
01:54:30,384 --> 01:54:33,057
Good! Stand by there! We're on our way!

1403
01:54:43,824 --> 01:54:45,894
- Which way now?
- That way.

1404
01:54:45,984 --> 01:54:48,782
- No, wait! This way!
- Are you sure?

1405
01:54:50,264 --> 01:54:51,743
Vasquez, move!

1406
01:54:54,504 --> 01:54:57,576
- Right up here! It's just up here!
- Hicks!

1407
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:59,655
We're almost there!

1408
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:02,215
Newt, wait!

1409
01:55:02,464 --> 01:55:03,613
Newt!

1410
01:55:19,664 --> 01:55:20,858
(Vasquez screams)

1411
01:55:27,384 --> 01:55:28,578
Vasquez!

1412
01:55:29,824 --> 01:55:30,813
Go!

1413
01:55:32,624 --> 01:55:35,297
Ohh! Ohh, no...!

1414
01:55:47,344 --> 01:55:48,333
Newt!

1415
01:55:48,424 --> 01:55:51,655
Up there!
There's a short cut across the roof!

1416
01:55:52,744 --> 01:55:53,733
Hicks!

1417
01:55:57,824 --> 01:55:59,257
(bullets run out)

1418
01:56:02,744 --> 01:56:04,814
You always were an asshole, Gorman.

1419
01:56:21,584 --> 01:56:23,575
- (Newt screams)
- Newt!

1420
01:56:23,664 --> 01:56:25,973
- Ripley!
- Newt!

1421
01:56:26,864 --> 01:56:29,901
Hicks! Hicks, get her! Hurry!

1422
01:56:33,184 --> 01:56:35,414
Oh! Hold on, Newt!

1423
01:56:35,504 --> 01:56:37,620
- I'm slipping!
- Don't let go!

1424
01:56:37,704 --> 01:56:39,695
- Ripley!
- Hold on!

1425
01:56:39,784 --> 01:56:41,695
- Help!
- Gotcha!

1426
01:56:42,664 --> 01:56:43,699
I gotcha!

1427
01:56:45,104 --> 01:56:46,935
(Newt screams)

1428
01:56:47,184 --> 01:56:49,778
Newt! No!

1429
01:56:52,824 --> 01:56:55,702
Come on! We can find her with this!

1430
01:56:55,784 --> 01:56:57,297
Stay where you are, Newt!

1431
01:56:57,384 --> 01:57:00,137
- (distant) Ripley...!
- We're coming!

1432
01:57:11,224 --> 01:57:13,374
Ripley!

1433
01:57:15,504 --> 01:57:17,176
(beeping)

1434
01:57:17,264 --> 01:57:18,697
This way.

1435
01:57:20,184 --> 01:57:21,981
She's close.

1436
01:57:22,064 --> 01:57:23,816
Newt!

1437
01:57:26,184 --> 01:57:28,175
Ripley!

1438
01:57:28,264 --> 01:57:30,619
Where are you! Can you hear me!

1439
01:57:31,744 --> 01:57:34,861
- Newt!
- Here! I'm here!

1440
01:57:34,944 --> 01:57:36,013
Where?!

1441
01:57:40,824 --> 01:57:42,815
Newt, are you OK?

1442
01:57:42,904 --> 01:57:45,418
Gonna have to cut it.

1443
01:57:45,504 --> 01:57:48,940
Climb down, honey.
We've got to cut through.

1444
01:57:56,624 --> 01:57:57,659
Newt?

1445
01:57:57,744 --> 01:58:00,542
Now don't move. Stay very still.

1446
01:58:00,624 --> 01:58:02,899
OK.

1447
01:58:02,984 --> 01:58:05,544
We're almost there. Hang in there, OK?

1448
01:58:05,624 --> 01:58:07,660
(beeping)

1449
01:58:12,344 --> 01:58:14,141
Hicks! Hurry!

1450
01:58:14,224 --> 01:58:15,657

1451
01:58:17,744 --> 01:58:20,702
(beeping continues)

1452
01:58:29,664 --> 01:58:31,541
Newt, just stay still!

1453
01:58:35,424 --> 01:58:36,459
Aagh!

1454
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:38,341
- Almost there!
- No!

1455
01:58:40,744 --> 01:58:41,733
Newt!

1456
01:58:53,424 --> 01:58:55,574
(screams) No! No!

1457
01:58:55,664 --> 01:58:58,053
- Let's go!
- No!

1458
01:58:58,744 --> 01:59:01,542
They don't kill you!
They don't kill you! They...

1459
01:59:02,224 --> 01:59:06,263
- She's alive! She's alive!
- All right! I believe you! She's alive!

1460
01:59:06,344 --> 01:59:08,335
We've got to go! Now!

Get it off!

1469
01:59:54,064 --> 01:59:56,055

(wind howling)

1471
01:59:58,304 --> 01:59:59,453
Go!

1472
02:00:02,664 --> 02:00:04,859
Come on, you can make it!

1473
02:00:27,144 --> 02:00:30,216
Bishop! How much time?!

1474
02:00:30,304 --> 02:00:32,260
Plenty! 26 minutes!

1475

In 19 minutes this area
is gonna be a cloud of vapour.

1479
02:02:03,704 --> 02:02:06,423

1480
02:02:08,744 --> 02:02:11,702
- See you, Hicks.

1481
02:02:13,304 --> 02:02:14,453
It's Dwayne.

02:14:02,104 --> 02:14:03,219
Bishop!

1519
02:14:03,304 --> 02:14:05,101
Goddamn you!

1520
02:15:06,304 --> 02:15:08,295
Close your eyes, baby.

1521

(Newt) Come on! Come on!

1523
02:15:48,424 --> 02:15:49,743
Punch it, Bishop!

1524

It's OK.

1525

We're OK.

1526

Hey.

He's gonna be all right.

1530
02:17:09,104 --> 02:17:12,574
He's just out. I had to give him
another shot for the pain.

1531
02:17:12,664 --> 02:17:15,542
We need a stretcher
to carry him up to medical.

1532
02:17:15,624 --> 02:17:17,216
OK.

1533
02:17:22,064 --> 02:17:26,023
I'm sorry if I scared you.
That platform was becoming too unstable.

1534
02:17:26,104 --> 02:17:30,097
I had to circle and hope that things
didn't get too rough to take you off.

1535
02:17:30,184 --> 02:17:31,617
Bishop...

1536

Oh, yeah.

- Mommy!
- Oh, God!

1558

Not bad for a... human.

1559
02:24:38,864 --> 02:24:41,537
Are we gonna sleep all the way home?

1560
02:24:41,624 --> 02:24:43,023
All the way home.

1561
02:24:43,104 --> 02:24:44,503
Can I dream?

1562
02:24:46,504 --> 02:24:49,223
Yes, honey. I think we both can.

1563
02:24:56,544 --> 02:24:58,136
Sleep tight.

1564
02:24:58,224 --> 02:24:59,816
Affirmative.
